Real Sex Workers Define the GFE (Girlfriend Experience) Posted on April 3, 2016 by Jeremy Lemur Headline: Real Sex Workers Define the GFE (Girlfriend Experience) Tweet On April 10th, Starz will launch its new series The Girlfriend Experience, a sure-to-be controversial show about the life of a high class prostitute. The Steven Soderbergh produced series premiered at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year and has received exceptionally good reviews. The trials and triumphs of the show’s main character, played by Mad Max: Fury Road’s Riley Keough, will likely provoke discussion about the state of prostitution in the 21st century, and will certainly introduce mainstream audiences to the term “girlfriend experience,” or its more commonly used acronym “GFE.” So, what exactly is a GFE? Anyone who has been searching online for a professional sexual companion over the past ten to fifteen years has probably encountered the term, because the GFE is indisputably the most popular offering in this current age of harlotry. When a customer negotiates with a prostitute for a BJ (fellatio), DATY (cunnilingus), or even an FMF (threesome) it’s pretty cut and dry what the experience will entail. But GFE is a nebulous designation that appears to have no conclusive definition. Obviously, the term implies that the prostitute will, to some extent, act like her client’s girlfriend. Wikipedia describes GFE as follows: Within the sex industry, GFE is a common term for a sexual encounter in which both the escort and the client are willing to engage in reciprocal sexual pleasure and some degree of emotional intimacy. Punter Forums and similar online prostitution communities have disputed the definition of the term ad nauseum, often boiling the experience down to a few affectionate acts that a person would perform with his or her significant other. French kissing, cuddling, foreplay, and an overall greater familiarity between client and courtesan are all associated with the girlfriend experience. But these are mere aspects of the service that shed little light on a sexual phenomenon that stems from a strong desire for empathy. To really understand GFE’s popularity, perhaps we should not only be asking what it is, but also why there is an increasing demand for it. In today’s high-tech society, we seem to be making connections at every turn, with every text, Facebook like, and Twitter update. But are these new tools augmenting our connectivity to one another or replacing a more personal way of conversing. These days, exchanges that used to require direct human contact are often reduced to dispassionate emails and emoticons. Maybe these poor excuses for connecting have us longing for something more substantial. Or perhaps as we juggle work, family, and sex in our fast-paced environment, it’s more difficult than ever for quality affection between two people to occur naturally, at the best time, and at the same level for each participant. One thing’s for sure: many people are paying for real, face to face (and body to body) intimacy with sex workers who encourage clients to lower their barriers, expose their vulnerabilities, and experience genuine emotion. People are craving the girlfriend experience like never before, and they’re purchasing the service again and again. The definition of GFE does not truly exist, at least not in a definitive form. The service is as diverse and varied as the sex workers who offer it and the customers who partake of it. Below is a sampling of personal perspectives on the girlfriend experience from women most qualified to speak on the subject: high-end courtesans currently working at Sheri’s Ranch, a legal Nevada brothel. The GFE party is everything you desire in a relationship without the every day hassles a relationship requires. It’s all the bonuses of a girlfriend. It’s the good times and none of the bad times. How would you like to enjoy a girlfriend for a day, a couple days, or a couple meetings a month over the span of a year?  Sounds great, right? It’s phenomenal! It’s THE experience, and with me it’s rarely a one time meeting. It’s about getting to know one another, understanding one another and caring for one another over many sessions. It’s taking the first encounter and building off each and every meeting. It’s about spending time together and getting involved in conversations and creating a comfort level to it’s extreme, where I actually become your most trusted confidante. It’s going from having mechanical sex to creating these extraordinary levels of sexual pleasures and developing an intimate rapport that arouses both of us to a point of unparalleled ecstasy. Take all the good times of a relationship and add the exceptional sexual pleasures and what you get is this ultimate experience of a lifetime. – Brittney Ryder Collecting money and having sex is a transaction. Listening and connecting is an experience. Blurring the line between the two and  turning the transaction into an experience is my description of The Girlfriend Experience. Personally I prefer being able to fulfill the role as your girlfriend rather than offering straight sex, getting the chance to know you and sharing more of myself. I am not a robot and neither are you. We both have feelings. Although some of my clients do want to get to the point, there are clients that want to feel an emotional connection. Holding hands on the couch and chatting, soaking in a bubble bath and staring into each other’s eyes, playing video or board games and laughing. The time spent building this connection leads to an amazing sexual euphoria shared by both. Feeling every moment instead of rushing for a finish. At the end of our experience we will know each other like old lovers anxiously awaiting our next time together  to try new things and build our brothel relationship. With no nagging or fighting!! Sounds like a dream…. But it can be made a reality. – Allissa I am extremely open-minded, I enjoy almost anything sexual. My Ideal party is sharing my time with a wonderful gentleman who will spoil me as much as I spoil him. I really like the GFE sessions where it feels like I am on a real date.  A nice gift upon arrival such as flowers, perfume, lingerie, sexy clothes or anything that makes you think of me is always a nice surprise. I just love seeing that chivalry still exists. In our private bungalow we relax by the fire, cuddling and listening to our favorite music. Taking things slow in the most sensual way, teasing and tantalizing one another. Enjoying an evening filled with romantic dinner, fun games, and scary movies where I can snuggle in your arms or you can comfort me while I jump and scream. We can slip into a nice bubble bath or hot tub – it’s great foreplay. I love the way our bodies slide against one another while we caress. Once we’re all worked up and begging for one another, we can retire to the bed for the most intimate pleasures of life. That’s just a small glimpse into my most desired session. There are more that I absolutely love, but I’ll just have to whisper those in your ear when we’re alone together. –  Destini GFE, or the Girlfriend experience is about making the best connection you can make, without the draw backs. Its getting to know someone intimately, getting comfortable. Spending quality time focused on another person and it being more than just sex, although the sex is definitely an amazing part of it. With the girlfriend experience you get to experience the care and adoration of a lover. Except its all about the positive side. No moody days, no stress on where you stand with one another – Just pure enjoyment.  With the girlfriend experience we have time to just relax and let things happen as they happen. Maybe we meet up and we just cant wait, and immediately connect for a passionate moment! Then spend a while after cuddling, giggling over little things, just enjoying one another, and maybe we do that for the rest of our time, maybe we go a couple more rounds. Maybe we go for a slow smoldering build of chatting over some champagne, or a meal, watching a movie, cuddling and then getting a bit more frisky as time goes on until we’re simply lost in each other. Everyone’s experience is a little different. People enjoy different things, and a different pace. The girlfriend experience is more than just sex. It really is an experience. I get to know you as an individual, and I get to soothe any worry you have, and create a space where the troubles of the world don’t exist. We’re focused on the now, and the time we have together. The intense pleasure of each others bodies, as well as the deeply felt pleasure of simply getting lost in another person. It’s simply the best experience I have to offer, as well as the best experience for myself to enjoy as well. I feel so much fulfillment when I get to give this type of experience, knowing the person I’m pleasuring, helping them get to know me and my body as well. There’s nothing better. – Terra Tweet This entry was posted in Girlfriend Experience.

Confessions of an escort girl: On sex, love and all the naughty bits in between (CU Independent/Adam Milner) Meet Nikki, a self proclaimed “country girl” born and raised in Colorado. She graduated from CU last year with a degree in psychology and regularly works and volunteers with children. You can find lots of girls like Nikki all over the college town of Boulder. I happened to find her on Craigslist’s Adult Services. “A little sweetness goes a long way,” she wrote on her ad. Her bubbly personality saturated every last detail of her profile, complete with Xs and Os. Nikki has been working in “the industry” on and off since she was 16-years-old. She is now a resource manager working with 4 to 6 girls at a time, selling their “company” for big money all around the Denver area and Boulder. “This is not full time by any means,” she said. When Nikki is not out on her “dates,” she works part-time as a bookkeeper and administrator. As the oldest of six kids, she also strives to set herself as an example by volunteering her time at church and the non-profit she works with. She tells me that she wants to open up her own non-profit for underprivileged kids in single-parent homes someday, or perhaps become a preschool teacher or a youth minister. “I want to be something more than what money can give,” she said. But for right now, she tells me, it’s all about the money. Sex is my business, and business is good Did you know that a girl working part-time as an escort can make just as much, if not more, than prestigious lawyers and doctors? According to Nikki, you can make what you earn in corporate America over two weeks in a single day, just by seeing two guys on a non full-service level. Full-service providers, she explains, sell straight up sexual intercourse, as opposed to non full-service providers, who sell everything but, such as their company for dates. “The most I’ve made in one day was $6,200 between three dates,” Nikki said. “Once one of my girls pulled in $56,000 from just one guy.” For Nikki and her girls, there are no pimps or agencies involved. The hard-earned cash is all theirs. All the girls she works with act as independent contractors who come to her for her resources, guidance and knowledge of the market and industry. “My job is to find the best places and resources for them to get the most out of what we’re marketing,” Nikki said. “The girls and I travel and we choose states where the economy is still steady and growing.” In return for Nikki’s help, they pay her a flat rate to post their services onto Craigslist for each of these areas. They’ve been all over the country including New York, California and even Hawaii. Big bucks, independence and travel? Sign me up, please? What you didn’t know about prostitution “I help men get a better understanding of sex through women,” Nikki said. Nikki said it’s not just about the sex itself, but about anything sexual in general. “I should be a sex therapist,” she joked. I’ve heard before that men who see prostitutes don’t just come for the sex, rather, they also seek all other aspects of female companionship. Speaking with Nikki gave me further insight on the matter. “They also look for uplift and reassurance. Just as human beings, they need it. You need a hug every once in a while, you need to be loved by the opposite sex or feel some kind of compassion,” Nikki said. This girl is all about the uplift, her sunny disposition is infectious and I love it. I’m sure her customers do, too. She also clued me in on all the different tiers of prostitution, ranging from “street walkers” to upscale escort girls. According to Nikki, there is “zero” street work. Colfax used to be prime hooker territory, but hasn’t seen the high level of street work it originally became famous for in years. Now, especially in Boulder, it’s all upscale, behind-closed-doors work. Before I talked to Nikki, I got this impression that prostitutes pretty much gave up every last ounce of their dignity in order to make money, rendering their decision power worthless. However, at least in the upper tiers of prostitution, the girls pretty much have the say on everything, from the guys they choose, what they want to do and how much they’ll be getting paid for it. “I’m picky,” Nikki said. “I just don’t see anyone. If I don’t like the guy, I won’t go through with the date. I’d be sweet and wouldn’t put him down, but I’d wean him to another girl who could better suit him and make him happier.” As far as the sex (or non-sex) goes, each girl decides on her own boundaries. Some don’t even provide full-service at all, rather, they may simply provide their company for dinners and dates. So how much cash is being thrown down for these girls? “It’s however much you want to make it. If they can’t pay that, then they’ll negotiate for whatever else,” she said. “The ball is always on my court.” The freakiest dudes in all the nation Of course, I had to ask Nikki about her strangest requests. She laughed and talked about golden Showers, strap-ons and the like. She did say the freakiest guys she’s ever seen throughout the country are in Boulder. Apparently, the white, older, hippie business guys are the ones to watch out for. “They have the weirdest requests,” Nikki said. “One guy wanted me to… What exactly do you call the opposite of a Golden Shower? I can’t even bring myself to talk about it, let alone do it.” She visibly struggled to find the words. “I can’t shit on anybody, sorry,” Nikki said. “And I won’t, plain and simple.” Word to the wives The majority of Nikki’s customers are married men who have been strictly with their wives for years or who have not had partners who are very sexual or open. “I give them something to go home and love their wives better with,” she said. I was intrigued. Could she convince me that prostitution could actually be conducive for a man’s love for his wife? “It’s men’s nature to want variety. It’s their animal instinct to breed with the most young and desirable women. It goes way back and love has nothing to do with it.” Nikki first explains that sex and love are two completely different things (for men anyway). According to Nikki, the guy has that one girl he loves, the one he marries. However, he also has his sexual needs. “He loves that one girl, but if he’s not getting what he needs or is deprived, he’ll become bitter towards her,” Nikki said. The idea is that once Nikki helps relieve these needs, it allows him to return to the one he is married to and carry on with their relationship, bitterness-free. “They might feel guilty, but it’s in their nature and they really need the sex. If their wives can’t give it to them, they feel badly about it,” Nikki said. Nikki said she believes that it’s human nature. “I also feel guilty to a certain extent, but really if the woman can’t give a man what he needs, he’ll go out and look for it elsewhere, plain and simple. And that’s where girls like me come in and give it to them,” Nikki said. It’s not purely about sex, though. Nikki said it’s also about the comfort her and her girls can give. “It’s not always physical, though,” she reminds me, “It’s also about uplift and reassurance.” The dichotomy of the “wife and the mistress” came to mind. Does it really all boil down to biological and evolutionary factors? Is this something we’ll all simply have to come to terms with? The good, the bad and the ugly “There really isn’t a least favorite aspect of the job,” Nikki said, “I love it all.” For Nikki, she said the job isn’t just about good pay, she genuinely enjoys it. “It’s like my dating scene. I pick and choose. I love older guys, men of power, well-dressed and charismatic. I’m completely engaged when we have fun and am totally enthralled by it. I wouldn’t do it if I didn’t like it. There’s no shame in what I do, I genuinely love everything I do.” To understand her passion, you also have to understand her philosophy. Nikki said she truly believes in doing what she does to not only bring uplift to her clients, but also to herself and her girls. “Girls might feel belittled, degraded or disrespected if they let themselves. If they put themselves in that position, then they absolutely will feel lesser for what they do,” Nikki said. Nikki said she only wants to be around girls who enjoy the job for what it is. “If at the end of the day you’re going to go home and feel like shit, then I don’t want to be a part of it. You have to genuinely like making the guys feel better,” Nikki said. “Then you feel better. It’s a mutual thing.” However, with the good also comes the bad. “I’ve been robbed, arrested, taken advantage of and hit. It’s all part of the risks. There are no policies and regulations for prostitution. It’s a free-for-all,” she said. There are some security measures they try to enact when they can, but ultimately the security measures can only do so much. “In big cities with all girls and no men, we have security people watching on the outside. But when you’re alone in a room with a guy, it doesn’t matter what kind of security you have. It’s you and him,” she said. Nikki and her girls take precautions and bring mace, switchblades and even take self-defense classes. She tells them that if it comes down to money, they should rather get ripped off than get raped or beaten. “You can replace that money,” Nikki said, “but you can’t replace yourself.” Then with the bad comes the ugly. Nikki revealed to me a darker part of her career. “I’ve been caught for prostitution and I’ve had a police officer come in and take complete advantage of me, and then turn around and arrest me for it,” she said. The experience of having a police officer violate her was one that Nikki won’t forget soon, if ever, she said. “At that point in my life, I would have felt better getting raped and robbed by somebody else, but having a police officer…” She said when the officer took her to court for prostitution she hired a good lawyer and got her case dismissed in court because of the fact that she had been raped. She said the officer didn’t confess, but all the evidence was there and he couldn’t deny it. “But it’s not just him, it’s hundreds of officers taking advantage of girls,” Nikki alleged. Legitimizing prostitution “If I would change anything about my job, it would be to make it legal,” Nikki said. Nikki said she believes that prostitution is illegal for the simple fact that the government cannot tax it. “I just feel like there’s so much that’s OK and that’s legal that is way worse than this,” she said. “If it’s consensual, the guy wants to do it and the girl wants to do it, who is the government to say it’s not OK?” I can sympathize with her on this. It’s difficult to work and pay tax dollars just to have a police officer rape you, turn around and arrest you for it, and have the law punish you for other acts that have been completely consensual. “It’s absolutely ridiculous that they can’t just let us do what we want, and because they can’t tax it they’re going to set up task forces that cost millions of dollars of tax money to stop something consenting adults want to do together,” Nikki said. Parting our ways Despite everything, Nikki said she has no regrets. “Anything that’s ever happened to me has made me stronger and built character,” she said. It has helped her go forward and teach other girls in the industry to help them realize what it really is, what it can be and what they may get out of it. “I’m here now in my place in the world to help people. No matter if it’s the children in the non-profits that I work for; to the women I hire to work for me. Ultimately the goal is to help them help the world.” When I first met Nikki, I had my doubts and my skepticism about the things she’s said and the things she believes in. Was she really so different from myself in those respects? Through our conversation, I realized that she is just like any other girl who channels her heart and soul into everything she does, including her own career. I got up to shake her hand, but instead she grabbed me and gave me a hug. She was happy, infectiously so, and all she wanted to do was to make others happy, too. At that point, it was hard not to believe in her.

I did not have even slightest of idea that any girl could understand men so accurately. Nikki understands that sex is something essential for us men..Rarely do women understand that..They think we’re devils if we want physical intimacy.. And she’s absolutely 101% right about one thing – It’s not just about sex. It’s also about uplift, reassurance, aspects other than sex.. being understood is the best luxury anyone can have. .

As the former wife of a married man who frequented the Boulder college escorts I can tell you with absolute certainty that his indiscretions did NOT enhance our marriage or sex life. In fact, quite the opposite. He became increasingly arrogant and abusive, which resulted in him getting caught, getting arrested, and losing everything. As a result of losing his home and family (we have two young daughters together), he tried to kill himself. So, it’s just sad and pathetic to hear some ignorant college girl talk about the benefits she’s providing to families by screwing the husbands. Yeah she’s screwing them, just not in the ways she thinks. Log in to Reply Sydney December 26, 2012 at 1:51 am how can I get into contact with Nikki? Log in to Reply Marlene Damaro March 3, 2013 at 4:54 am Thank you for this uplifting story. From what I read in forums, it seems that many sex workers are getting exploited and only do it for the money. My experience as escort girl has been generally positive. I’m a medical student in Germany and have been doing high-priced escort work for almost 3 years. First 6 months with an agency in Switzerland and then as independent escort in Germany (and occasionally Basel and Ibiza). Prostitution is legal in most European countries. Perhaps I’m lucky that I managed to quickly build a repeat customer business, so I avoid risking negative surprises with first-time clients. My customers treat me well, are well-mannered and well-groomed and quite generous. Two or 3 dates a month are enough to finance my study and lead a comfortable life. Sure, there are downsides like leading a double-life because prostitution is stigmatized and the fear of getting exposed. It certainly is not a job for every girl, but I’m sexually liberal, like to please and be pleased by men, and I enjoy having sex. It makes me feel good when I can make my customers happy, not only by having sex but also by listening, showing understanding and giving warmth.

Moderators: delphyne, oneangrygirl, deedle, sam Post a reply 1 post • Page 1 of 1 prostitution terminology & slang by sam » Wed Jul 26, 2006 5:25 pm Prostitution Terminology By Joseph Parker, Clinical Director The Lola Greene Baldwin Foundation http://www.prostitutionrecovery.org/pro ... ology.html The following list of prostitution terminology was accumulated by working directly with prostituted women, children, and men, as well as pimps. Some also came from law enforcement and other agencies which have contact with prostituted people. Some prostitution terms are stable and very old. Others are rapidly changing or regional. The main purpose, other than to evade law enforcement, is to make the kids and adults being prostituted feel special and different from "squares" and support their fantasy that they have more glamor and more control of their lives than they do. Some terms are not from the common language because they refer to experiences luckier people are unlikely ever to have. ARRANGEMENTS OR UNDERSTANDINGS: in places where prostitution is legal, the drug laws are not abolished, yet prostitution sites need large and regular drug deliveries to keep their prostituted people numb enough to survive and keep working. Agreements are made not to enforce the drug laws around protected establishments. The government officials and businessmen involved usually are paid in money, sometimes in drugs for their own use, but almost always, in special sexual services. These often are secretly videotaped in case the arrangement needs to be helped along with blackmail. AUTOMATIC: when the pimp is out of town, in jail, or otherwise not in direct control of those he is prostituting, the victims "automatically" go out to prostitute without being ordered to. AROUND THE WORLD: vaginal intercourse (chiefly from trucking industry). BABY 'HO: unusually young person being prostituted. Age 12 and younger are not unusual. BAREBACKING: sex without a condom. Some HIV positive men will not disclose their status but offer extra money. Also sought by others whose HIV status is unknown. Almost everyone in prostitution very long becomes hepatitis C positive. BED DANCING: a strip club performance in which a naked or nearly naked woman will dance on top of a clothed man on a bed in a private room. Readily escalates to acts of direct prostitution. BITCH (AS WELL AS CUNT, 'HO, SLUT, ETC.): used by pimps and customers to address or refer to prostituted women, and often nude dancers. BOTTOM BITCH (PREVIOUSLY BOTTOM LADY): a pimp who has more than one woman under his control will appoint one woman to supervise the others, report rule violations, and often help inflict punishment on them. Some, in later life, will go on to become pimps, madams and escort service operators themselves. BREAK A BITCH: when the pimp, or someone acting for him, takes all the money a prostituted person has earned. May be done several times a day. BREAKING IN A NEW BITCH: things a pimp does to take control of a new victim. (Related word: "seasoning".) BROTHEL, BORDELLO, CATHOUSE, WHOREHOUSE: may be a large apartment or actual house, or, in Nevada and other countries, a specially built facility for selling sex on the premises. Often has extreme security measures to prevent attacks by other criminals seeking the large amounts of cash and dope kept there. The security is two sidedÐto keep the women and children in, as well as robbers out. The places often are guarded (and open) 24 hours a day, but some have closing times in which the victims are locked in from the outside. CAR TRICK, CAR DATE: prostituted person is picked from the street by a john for the purpose of having sex in the vehicle. Very dangerous, because once in the car, she is isolated and under his control. He can do anything, including robbery, assault, dumping her naked in a remote area, or even murder. Entering a vehicle with more than one man in it, or getting into a closed van are even more dangerous. CATCHER: usually younger, "wannabe pimps", who watch prostitution victims on "the track" or in other prostitution venues, to make sure they are following the pimp's orders. CAUGHT A CASE: either the pimp or a prostituted person has been arrested and charged with a crime. CHOOSE: the victim can be told she has chosen a pimp by as little as making eye contact with him. Usually involuntary, but some more experienced women may be able to negotiate a change of pimps if they have the fee. CHOOSING FEE OR CHANGING FEE: amount paid by prostituted person to the original pimp to compensate him for what he has lost in the course of the victim changing over to the control of a different pimp. CIRCUIT (OR TRACK): a set area where prostituted people are regularly available. This can be the area around a group of strip clubs and pornography stores or a particular stretch of street. Within a country, it can be a series of cities among which prostituted people are moved, such a as the west coast circuit of San Diego, Las Vegas, Vancouver, BC and cities in between. It can also be a chain of states, such as the "Minnesota pipeline" by which victims are moved through a series of states, from Minnesota to markets in New York. CLUB EXECUTIVE: manages sex industry clubs and bars. Often claims to own or partially own the business. Often they do not, but are acting to conceal ownership by one of the communities major "respectable businessmen" or organized crime. Attempts to trace true ownership often lead only to holding companies and corporations that only exist in some attorney's office. COMBAT ZONE: municipal strategy of trying to confine sexually oriented businesses to a small area, one in which the residents are poor and small legitimate businesses in decline. The zone also becomes the center for street prostitution, drug dealing and high rates of other crime. The idea is to protect "better" areas from the increased crime rates, degraded quality of life and falling property values. This strategy has generally failed because the combat zones bring in more customers from a wider area, and more businesses are established, resulting in the problems spreading to other parts of the community. COMIN' UP: refers to a victim recently turned out who is bringing in good money. COUCH DANCING: a strip club performance which may very from club to club and area to area. Sometimes it will involve dancing on a box between the trick's legs, other times it will consist of straddling the trick while he lies on a couch. The customer usually is clothed, while the woman is naked or nearly so. It may take place in an open club area, or in a private booth set up to facilitate direct prostitution. DADDY: what pimps require their victims to call them. They may refer to themselves as "Pimp Daddy" when among people like themselves. DATE: describes a prostitution customer or the activity of prostitution. For example, "with a date" or "dating". The word "trick" also has dual meaning. DUAL SYSTEM: in jurisdictions with legal prostitution, one part of the industry complies with licensing, health checks, and taxes. Inevitably, a parallel system develops outside the law, because many pimps do not want to pay taxes, and do want the freedom to use underage children and high levels of violence. Legal or not, almost all operators of prostitution businesses have a fundamental criminal orientation. ESCORT SERVICE: organization operating chiefly through cell phones and pagers, which sends prostituted people to the trick's location (an outcall), or arranges to have the john come to a house or apartment which may be the workplace of a single woman or actually a small brothel (an incall). Some are networked with others and can assemble large numbers of women for parties and conventions. Others serve those with special tastes such as children or sadomasochism. EUROPEAN: sometimes used to refer to acts involving urine, feces, and other things. EXIT FEE: money a pimp will demand from a victim who is thinking about trying to leave. It will be an exorbitant sum, to discourage her from leaving. Most pimps never let their victims leave freely. FAMILY OR FOLK: group of people under the control of one pimp, who plays the role of "father". This idea can be psychologically complicating for a victim who never had a family before. FINES, TAXES: failed ideas for controlling prostitution. When people are convicted of prostitution and fined, they must do even more prostitution to pay the fines. When governments tax legal sex businesses in which prostitution is none the less allowed, the taxes are paid in large part from the income from prostitution. The courts and government become just another layer of pimps who have to be paid. FINESSE PIMP: one who prides himself on controlling others primarily through psychological manipulation. Still, the threat of violence is always there. FISTING: forcing a closed fist up someone's vagina or anus. For a few people, an erotic act. More commonly used by pimps and johns to extensively damage a woman's pelvic organs, permanently injuring her. Can be imperfectly repaired if the victim is able to seek treatment. FOLLOW YOUR MONEY: phrase pimps use to warn prostituted people to take care of the money they are given. Losing money by some means, such as being robbed by a trick, will result in being turned back out to work 24 hours a day until the money is replaced, and the daily quota is also met. FRONTS: money a pimp will give his victims to use for cab fare, drinks and condoms. Also called "walking around money". THE GAME: the sex industry generally. Pimps are called "players". GOLDEN SHOWER: a "sex" act in which one person urinates on another. Also "water sports", a term more commonly used in gay prostitution. GORILLA PIMP: one who controls his victims almost entirely through violence. Also, there are gorilla 'hoes who assist a pimp in controlling his "stable" chiefly through violence. HALF AND HALF: an act of prostitution in which there is both oral and vaginal sex. Priced somewhat lower than each act would be individually. HAND JOB: prostituted person brings john to orgasm by manual masturbation. In massage parlors, called a "hand finish". HARD CORE: two meanings when used in pornography. May mean showing an erect penis in action. May also refer to pornography when an actor, usually female, gets hurt, such as by violent anal sex. 'HO: person being prostituted. Short for whore. HO VINE: "grape vine"-like networks of communication among people being prostituted. HO LINE: loose network of communication between pimps, chiefly by phone, inter-city and interstate. Often uses changing slang and code words to confound law enforcement along the "circuit". Used to trade, buy, and sell prostituted women and children. HUSTLER: someone who will do anything for money: sell drugs, steal, scam and pimp. Also more specific to a person prostituted in the gay trade. IZZ OR IZZN: added to words to give a different sound, like "pig latin". To make surveillance and presenting evidence in court more difficult. Along with changing specialized slang, may require prosecutors to provide expert witness to translate for the court. JACK SHACK: lingerie modeling, massage parlors and other operations where tricks masturbate while watching women in revealing clothes, underwear or lack thereof. Almost always have facilities for on-site prostitution. JOHN: person buying another for sexual gratification. Primary cause of prostitution. Comes from alias often used by customer if asked their name. May also derive from euphemism for toilet. KIDDIE STROLL: area of the stroll featuring kids under sixteen, often much younger. Especially prominent in countries where prostitution is legal, but has minimum age limits of 18 years or so. Largest kiddie stroll in North America is in Vancouver, B.C., Canada, where public solicitation is illegal but not prostitution itself. LAP DANCING: strip club act in which a woman will grind her body into the lap of a trick. While the trick is clothed, the woman may be naked or nearly so. LAY SOME DRAG: the way the victim is taught to talk to people not involved in prostitution. LICK HITTER: severely addicted person who prostitutes just enough to get a dose of drugs or alcohol. When that wears off, she is back on the "track" until she can get another dose. May go on for days or weeks at a time, with serious health consequences. THE LIFE: in earlier times, "the sporting life" The experience of being used in prostitution. Virtually always involves heavy drug and alcohol use, violence and other crime. LOT LIZARD: person who picks up tricks at truck stops. May service an individual trucker while traveling with him from place to place. MADAME: older woman who manages brothel. May have been prostituted in her earlier years, but may be a pimp/career criminal in her own right. Often supports the women's outside pimp/boyfriend/fiance/husband by calling him when victim gets off work, and telling him exactly at what time she left and exactly how much money she had when she left. OUT OF POCKET: person not under control of a pimp. Will be vulnerable to threats, harassment and violence in order to make them "choose" a pimp. Also may mean in violation of pimp's rules. OUTLAW: prostituted person generally successful in avoiding control by pimps. PEEL A TRICK: when a prostituted person steals money, checkbooks, and credit cards from a customer. May be used by members of prostitution group or sold to others who "hang paper" or do identity theft. PEEP SHOWS, LIVE SEX SHOWS: usually found in pornography stores. The trick sits behind a glass partition, and directs sexual activity by women and/or men, with or without sex toys and other props, to fulfill his fantasies. PIMP: person who persuades or forces his victims to engage in prostitution. The pimp collects the money paid by the johns, essentially for his services in using whatever manipulation or force is needed to keep the women and kids serving the johns desires. PIMP HARD: to raise quotas, reduce rest times, and/or require victims to accept tricks they would ordinarily avoid. PIMP PARTY: when several pimps come together to rape, beat, drug, and torture someone who is resisting being prostituted, or who was "out of line" by trying to escape, talking to the police, or whatever. Can go on for days. PIMP STICK: a steel whip made out of coat hanger wire. May be heated on a stove to burn as well as cut tissue. Other items, such as appliance cord, towel bars and shower curtain rods, cigarettes and curling irons also may be used to inflict overwhelming pain. PORNOGRAPHY: sexual activity depicted in words, pictures or films solely for sexual stimulation of others, and for monetary gain. The sex industry tries to keep it protected by claiming it to be "art", under freedom of speech. Generally repetitive, following only a few standard formulas. Some "actors" are voluntary, but many are prostituted, having been "ordered" from a local pimp for particular roles. Is addictive to many people. Obsession with it may terminate any normal sex life the addicts had, and cause them to spend far more money and time on their addiction than they can afford. Has a major role in "fueling" some users to the point they cross over from fantasy to actual violent crime. PRIVATE DANCE: couch, bed or other "dances" which often take place in private rooms at an extra charge. This offers men the opportunity to pressure women into more direct acts of prostitution to earn tips. QUOTA: amount of money prostituted person must turn over to the pimp before they can stop prostituting and go home. Commonly $500/day. RABBIT: a prostituted person who goes from one pimp to another too frequently. RECKLESS EYEBALLING: when a prostituted person looks at another pimp, which is strictly forbidden. RENEGADE: prostituted person not under control of a pimp. ROLL A TRICK: robbing a trick with force by prostituted person, the pimp, or his associates. Usually involves weak or intoxicated tricks. SCAT: sexual activity centered on feces. SEASONING: combination of psychological manipulation, intimidation, gang rape and sodomy, beatings, deprivation of food and sleep, cutting off from family, friends and other sources of support and threatening or holding hostage of victim's children. Purpose is to totally break down victim's resistance and ensure that she will do anything she is told. SHOWER DANCING: strip club performance in which women are placed naked in a transparent shower. Paying customers may be allowed to apply soap or lotions to their bodies. SISTER WIFE, SISTER-IN-LAW, WIFE-IN-LAW, STABLE SISTER: what women in a pimp's stable call each other. SPONGES: pimps keep their victims working all day, every day, year round ("24/7" is originally a prostitution term). There is no time off for menstruation. Instead of being allowed to use tampons, the women are required to cut up pieces of kitchen sponges and insert them in their vaginas to absorb menstrual blood without the john's noticing, as they would with a tampon. Pimps who want to humiliate the women may make them trade sponges. If he wants to inflict pain, he may make them use sponge/scotchbrite pads with the scotchbrite facing inward. SPORT, BJ, BLOW JOB, FRENCH: oral sex SQUARE: anyone not involved in the life of prostitution. STABLE: group of people under the control of a single pimp. The choice of a farming word is not accidental. Pimps consider their victims to be no better than animals. STRAIGHT SEX, STRAIGHT LAY: vaginal intercourse. STREETWALKER, 'WALKER: someone who primarily contacts tricks by walking the street and making nonverbal signals that they are available. May do car tricks or have a motel room nearby. STRIP CLUBS: a legal system of prostitution in which women and men take their clothes off for the sexual stimulation of customers. Often have private "VIP rooms" for on-site prostitution. STROLL: sections of street commonly used to market sex between johns in cars and women and kids on foot. If it is in a poor neighborhood, or a commercial area not open at night, and therefore there are few complaints to city officials by anyone considered to matter, the area may serve as a kind of "red light" district for decades. SWEATING A BITCH: when a pimp puts pressure on a prostituted person to accept them as their pimp. Methods include stalking, harassment, assaults and outright kidnapping. TABLE DANCING: strip club performance in which a woman will dance on a small platform they carry around with them, or dance on the actual table around which one or more men are seated. The men are clothed while the dancer may be nude or nearly so. TIP: a term used in the escort and massage areas of prostitution. This is the amount actually received by the prostituted person, while the agency gets the "service charge". TRAP: the money or the location where it is hidden while on the circuit. A pimp may empty these traps several times a day. TRACKER: a man who will go after an escaping prostituted person, kidnap them, and return them to the pimp for a fee. TRADE UP, TRADE DOWN, BUY AND SELL: pimps dispose of victims giving them problems, or who no longer match the profile sought by the clientele the pimp normally serves. They may trade straight across, with some money or in return for two or more other victims. The buy/sell price is usually low: $2500 to $3500. The women/kids can be moved long distances rapidly, such as from Portland, OR to Atlanta, GA, with a guard, overnight by air. TRICK: describes both the act of prostitution and the person buying it. Or example, "turning a trick" or "with a trick". TURN OUT: used both to describe being forced into prostitution and a person newly involved in prostitution. "She was turned out at the age of 14 years", or "Syd is a turn out". WORKING: engaged in active prostitution. WORKING GIRL: euphemism for a prostituted woman.

http://happyendingz.blogspot.com/2008/01/massage-parlor-code-words-and-lingo.html|_|skip to main | skip to sidebar Happyendingz - confessions of an erotic masseuse My name is CJ, and I'm an Erotic Massage Therapist. Now if you don't know what that is - I work in a massage parlor. Ever drive by one of those places with a red neon sign that says "SPA" and wonder what goes on behind those blackened windows? Well I'm gonna tell ya my massage parlor secrets! I'll teach you what a "Happy Ending" is and all the little tricks I use to give one. So just lay back, relax, and let me do my job... And remember - I work for tips. Thursday, January 10, 2008 Massage Parlor Code Words and Lingo Someone commented to me the other day that they like the idea of my new blog, but sometimes don’t understand the terms I use. I kinda forgot that I’m supposed to be teaching you guys this stuff, so I'll go over the basic lingo we use in the business. So here goes: “The Business” (also referred to as a “Massage parlor” or “Spa”): This is my place of employment where customers come in for a relaxing massage with a little something extra at the end. The Business should not be confused with a “Brothel” which is just sex. Believe it or not, we’re actually expected to provide quality massages here. In fact, most of the girls here are/were licensed massage therapists. “Happy ending” (also referred to as a “Release,” “Climax” or “Money shot”): These are the code words we use to talk about making a guy cum. I personally prefer the term “Release” and use it when talking to customers. When describing to newbies what I do, I find it sounds more professional to say “...I end the massage with a release,” rather than “… when I’m done I’ll jerk you off.” There are different types of releases. The most common is the Hand Release, a.k.a. Handjob. 99% of my sessions end with this one. Another type of release is the Breast Release – also referred to by the more crass term “Tittyfucking.” Another is the Butt Release where the guy lubes up your ass cheeks and slides it between them. There are other variations, but you get the picture. I charge extra for anything other than a hand release, so I don’t get many chances to do one. “Options”: This is the term we use to describe the various ways we provide our massages. For my customers I usually offer these 3 Options: 1) Topless, 2) G-string, 3) Nude. I guess each is self explanatory. There is no real difference to the massage, its just that the guy pays according to the type of view he wants. “Therapeutic”: You could call this the “4th” option. This is a session where the man (or woman) wants nothing more than a legitimate therapeutic massage. NO HAPPY ENDING. In fact, for most of these customers, they are not even aware of our Options! You can imagine why this is our least favorite of the options since we make almost no money off these. Why do we do them you ask? Remember – WE ARE A MASSAGE BUSINESS. And sometimes you have to do what you have to do to keep up the appearance of being legitimate. A lot of these customers are locals who just have no clue, and the one thing you really can't afford to do in this business is make waves with the locals. “Customer” or “Clients”: I wanted to point out that we have customers like any other business. We do not call them “Johns” or “Tricks” or “Dates” like hookers do. “Session” or “In Session”: This is when you’re working with a customer. I’ll say “I’m in Session…” when I’m busy with a client. “Full Service”: Sex. This is the difference between your standard massage parlor and a brothel. A woman or business that offers straight sex above and beyond a handjob is referred to as “Full Service.” It doesn’t necessarily mean you won’t be offered Full Service in a massage parlor – but that’s between you and your masseuse. Well, this is the basic lingo to get you around most businesses. If you have any questions about specific terms you’ve heard before, please ask. Happy hunting!

What do you know about them? 1/12/08, 1:22 AM Ronald said... Okay, I get the lingo, but how does everything "go down." For instance, I walk into your place and when we get into the massage room, and you explain the three different options, how do I know a happy ending goes with that? Am I supposed to ask? If I don't say anything, will you skip it? Thanks! 4/16/08, 5:35 PM cj said... Ronald, ALL options come with a happy ending. This is true in any massage parlor. If you take no options, then you'll get a "therapeutic" massage - in which case you get no happy ending. Now if a masseuse offers you options, you can always feel free to verify that. BUT if she offers no options and just starts with the massage - DON'T ASK! You're probably in a legitimate business, or the masseuse doesn't trust you. CJ 4/16/08, 11:34 PM Anonymous said... What is NOVA? 5/5/09, 9:57 PM John said... THANK YOU! I've been waiting so long for one of these days. how much do each of these options usually cost? When exactly should i pop the question? At the front desk... In the room as I walk in... or as I lay down? How could I get my happy ending without spooking her? 9/20/09, 12:46 AM Anonymous said... CJ, I was recently at a massage establishment and ended up getting an erection during the massage. Because the sheet was pretty thin and she was massaging my quads and groin, I'm sure it was noticeable. The therapist asked around that time, "Are you hungry?" I said, "Yes" half hoping the question was code. She then said where are you going to eat and the conversation went on to restaurants other than once more she said, I'm sorry I made you hungry. This was a legit place, but I wonder whether you think this conversation was about food or something else. What do you think? Massage Lover 2/9/10, 12:10 AM Anonymous said... CJ. I have been to a Asian massage but for some reason get really nervous and cannot get an erection until she is actually starting the release. How often does this happen to you? Is it frequent? I notice it when I am nervous and develop shrinkage. :( When she leaves I try to get it going before she returns. Any advice? Any recommendations on how to relax so when its "turn over" time I can show I am ready to begin? Thank you! 5/23/10, 10:07 PM Anonymous said... If you said ":Russian" instead of "breast release", some customers might understand better. At first I thought you meant some kinky stuff involving milk discharges from pregnant masseuses... I've posted elsewhere about it: all that looking down on "brothels" is your deal, but the misinformation is getting old. While it's true that SOME full service houses are just staffed by young and clumsy illegals in the case of AMPs (never saw any drugs, BTW, and I've looked at every inch of the girls' bodies so I think I'd have seen the signs), it is not the rule that you make it to be at all. One particular brothel I spent a fortune at ONLY had licensed therapists on staff (not just a token one for cops) and hid condoms so well that they were never found during a raid. Took more than 10 years and several visits by undercovers to get it closed down. The owners think that customers or the parlor across the street ratted them out, because everything seemed legit unless you were in the know. Their customers included cops, an attorney, actors, and a movie exec, according to one girl - you think those people get laid with junkies in flea-infested, mob-owned ratholes? A LOT of FBSM ads are placed by LMTs and nurses who rent a trick pad with a couple of girfriends and sometimes they offer full service or tantra stuff. I'm not gonna publicize them for the curious, but escort and escort/MP review sites are full of leads. So just because a girl sells it all, it doesn't mean she's not licensed and therefore lower than you. There. Since I'm an asian lover I wouldn't claim that most of my FS experiences were with LMTs, however, although some had been therapists in their country of origin. But they all gave a good to very good massage, thank you. The fact that I usually want to go straight to sex with my regulars is MY choice, and that can hurt their feelings because asians could give you pointers about customer service, from your writings here. Some Koreans will even help you dress up when done, a little freaky to us westerners. Another thing that irritates me on your blog is the mention that every act has to be discussed and that money has to be given beforehand. In the majority of cases, legit massages to FS GFE, I have spoken very little (polite pleasantries and compliments) with asians and paid last. Could be the language barrier and shyness of the girls, but that's been part of the charm for me. The whole bargaining and planning thing is so clinical and, frankly, what you'd expect from a hooker. "Well, show me the money, honey!" And paying last has always seemed to ensure that the girl would try to impress me, and to tailor the amount to my satisfaction level and to what actually happened during the session, which CAN be unpredictable - we're not robots. 9/14/10, 11:48 AM Anonymous said... Correction: there IS money paid upfront, at the desk, and it's the house fee. What goes on in the room, between provider and monger, is what's negotiable and unpredictable, hence my preference for tipping at the end. I've had one or two girls ask to see the green or how much I was going to tip, and I indulged them, but that's not my M.O. and the majority of asians seem perfectly fine with it. Do business your way (I'll be the one reader to say that I hope to NEVER set foot in your parlor), but please understand that it's not the only way, or even the rule, and that those who act differently are not necessarily inferior (and drug-addicted-illegal-skanky-slaves-who-talk-funny). 9/14/10, 12:01 PM Anonymous said...

You fucking bitch! This is Derek! I checked your computer when you went into the shower this morning. You have told total strangers everything about yourself, and here I am your boyfriend, the one you supposedly wish to keep for 1 year, the one who has satiated your vaginal deep dicking desires anytime and everytime you have craved my king size twix peanut butter, and I find out this way? That's right, it's big, long and sweet. Since we're dishing out everything, maybe your readers would care to find out how we met. Well people, here it is... It was a dark and stormy night. The winds were blowing due East, I was walking out of my hotel at the Abraham Lincoln on 5th on my way to Golds Gym. I was in town on business. I'm from California. Anyway, there she was at the entrance under an umbrella, nearly drenched. Hair disheveled and looking like a homeless goat. I pass her, but then I thought, maybe I can offer some help. So, I go up to her... "Excuse me, miss... I'm new in town. Could you give me directions to your heart?" She looked at me, silence... and then she burst into uncontrolled laughter spraying my face. "Hahaha, you're a dork." she says. "Alrighty, then. Tell you what, whoever you're waiting for isn't coming. Let's go to that Starbucks over there." I guess I'm not going to workout today. It's okay though, because it's Tuesday, and it's only biceps, triceps, and deltoids day. I didn't want to invite her into my room even though it was just there. I didn't know if she was an axe murderer. A public place with many witnesses is good just to get her out of the pouring rain so she won't get pneumonia. "Is that right?" "What, you're waiting for some guy you met on e-harmony. They all like long walks on the beach, and there's only a river here... hardly a beach. He's not coming." She pauses for a moment, and flutters her eyes looking at me. It was as if she was melting. Anyway, either it's the rainwater or she's high. We walk over to the starbucks, we order, and then she tells me her story. Bla bla bla... she finishes her drink, and all that's left in my short java chip frappucino is the whipped cream. "So... tell you what, I'll drive you home. Do you live far from here?" "I live about 12 miles that way." She points to some vague direction to my right. "Okay, well, let me get my keys in my room. You can come up if you'd like. I was going to take a cab to the gym." "Sure." So there we went. I slide in my card key to open the door. And we go in. So I said, "Make yourself at home. I'm going to go into the restroom for a minute." "Sure, okay." I go into the rest room. I unbutton my jeans and then proceed to drain the Red October. There I am minding my own business, and then suddenly the door opens behind me and a hand reaches around and grips perfectly my nuclear powered submarine. Then I hear a whispering... "Shh... just relax." Me, taken aback couldn't help but ask, "Uhm... what are you doing?" "I'm giving you a relaxing massage." 4/6/11, 12:19 PM Derek said... "Is that right?" "Hmm... what options would you like?" "Options???" I turn around, and she was in her tight white short nurses' outfit wet as rain, and already partially undone. "Yes. Would you like to see my boobs? Or maybe something more?" At this point, I thought, I'll play along. I know Ashton Kutcher is outside with a camera crew punking me. "Well, how about we take off all your clothes because they're all wet." Then I ease her into bed. "Sure, why don't you take them off me?" So I proceed to take off her nurse's hat, and then start unbuttoning her dress. And then she grabbed my hands and put them aside, "No, no no." "But... I thought..." "Not with your fingers silly. Take my clothes off with your teeth." I try to unbutton her clothes as instructed, and she helped a little bit. My face would occasionally rub on her nipples and feeling the soft warm caress of her breasts. I play along. At this point, she's fully naked... and when I wasn't expecting it, she pushes me, and I fall on the bed. She jumps on me and straddles me. "Shh... just relax... and lay back." She reaches down my black CK boxer briefs and finds the missile has been armed. She's on top of me, laying down and kisses me behind the ears... "Mmm... what is that? What are you wearing?" "Uhm, nothing... just burberry." "Mmm....yummy... g-r-r-o-o-w-l" "Wait, should we be doing this? I don't even know your name." "My name is CJ. It stands for Cum Junkie. Meow..." So she starts stroking my cock, and I noticed she was using the ancient crouching tiger hidden dragon kung fu grip technique flawlessly. I didn't mention it and just let her keep going. At this point, I was starting to lose myself... my mind. Like a tiger, I grab wrists, and in one motion pulled her onto the bed and turned. Her hands are pinned to the bed, and our eyes meet. Without saying a thing, I slide down slowly... she spreads her legs a little, and I get in between them. I didn't enter her... but my erect cock touch her clit. "Oh, Derek..." she moans. "Please..." "Please, what?" "Please put it inside of me..." I ignored her... I didn't put it inside... I just kept on rubbing her clit. And then she starts to make those involuntary twitches... "Ah!" short, high-pitched ahhs. Wait... hey is there any potato chips in here? CJ, all those times we've shared. All those times when you cried please stop just when you've orgasmed for the sixteenth consecutive time on my hard unmedicated love making magic wand and I ignored and continued on until you broke into tears in sheer ecstasy in the bathroom, in the kitchen, in the bedroom, in the alley behind the laundry place, I thought those were real. I thought we shared those special moments. I thought you meant it because I know I did. Now I know you were just working me. CJ, I'm a man. I'm not just a piece of meat. I'm not just a sex toy for your utter, total, and complete satisfaction. I have feelings. I am a man. I have emotions too. We're done. It's over. I'm leaving back for California. I am a man, CJ and I deserve better. Hear me roar! Arf! Arf! Derek 4/6/11, 12:19 PM Roar said... Derek, you're not a man. You're an idiot. 4/8/11, 10:35 AM firealarmguy84 said... found an asian place above a truck stop but how do I know if they do happy endings or what the seceret word is 6/18/11, 6:27 PM cj said...

CJ 7/1/11, 10:59 PM Anonymous said... so i called up this asian place near my house i found on rubmaps.com and i asked if they ended their service with a 'release' and the woman had no clue what i meant... 7/5/11, 9:41 AM harrisburger said... In Harrisburg... Really struggling to find a happy ending massage. Started on Craigslist and read a posting that I thought had all the right signs of what I was looking for. Turned out to be a not so great massage, with a not so happy ending. The woman was middle aged and about 300lbs too. I would have overlooked both of those things if she was exceptionally good at the ending, but she acted like I was a pervert when I asked about it. I really don't want to keep paying people in HOPES they will pan out. If someone knows where I can get what I'm looking for, I sure would appreciate the tip. For the record: I'm a 40 year old, married, handsome, clean, super nice guy. Not a creeper. Could be a regular customer if I find the right girl. 7/11/11, 1:03 PM Ran said... Hey, found ur blog today I guess u could call me another "fan"  I know your out of the "business" and you have a lot to deal with but I wanted to twist your arm for a little advise, if I may?  First I wanted To share alittle first. I hope you take this in a respectful way. I wanted to say after reading alot of your blog, starting in 07 reading, you sounded ok with the work you are doing, til now you sound like u have some  moral issue or maybe it caused you a lot of mental stress. But you are LMt you sound like you give one hell of a massage and work hard for your money. If you get some nice respectful Clients u offer them options, you sound like you handle it very professional, I see it as going above and beyond your job.   But from the outside almost looks like you have gone beyond too many times for people who haven't treated you like a professional.  Just by reading the blog I can tell you can read people and not once have seen you complained about the massage part of the work. Maybe just re-look at who those above and beyond clients should be, well not just maybe, that's just being respectful to yourself. If this is time for you to move on then do you need to stay happy, but don't let some assholes drive you away. Your way too good for this business to let some dumb person get to you.   I wanted to share alittle about me and what led me to finding this hunt to find the lmt that gets paid in tips.  I'm a workalcohcolic, after the last two years of many rough months I have pushed though all the bs the world has thrown my way. I have became very sick for nine months I have been battling extreme fatigue and dizziness, let's get to the point, with the chonic back pain I have. I got curious for massage to deal with pain. Now I'm thinking can't I get both, release to do away with undo stress and be able to relax. I have thought of it, but approaching the situation i couldn't just go and expect some cute girl to do a full service I'm not disrespectful.  Now for alittle advise I want to make sure I have all this clear so I'm not getting a massage and acting like a disrespectful ass. So.... Get scheduled  To the room talk about general life and enjoy her company then and if I'm given options (normally sometimes on return visits, after two move on) 1. Topless 2-3 so on  Pick  And 1-3 gets a finish and 4 nothing ...  Just need to make sure I'm offered a option, which I'm lost how that will come up.  I do tip well, I like to take care of good people.  Thanxs for the advise, I'm sure you will start that tanning business. You have that professional attitude. 7/19/11, 9:49 PM Anonymous said... I found this site to be very informative, but unfortunately, none of it seems to apply in Harrisburg, PA. I guess I would need to travel for it to be possible... Either that or I'm really having bad luck with your suggestions. 7/27/11, 1:43 PM Anonymous said... For those of you looking for a real fbsm you may want to see if there is a myredbook.com in your area. I find it to be an effective way to know what I am getting into before I pay for a massage without the "release". Good luck! 10/21/11, 2:16 PM Anonymous said...

America’s first legal male prostitute looks back on short-lived career Brothel owner calls for action against illegal prostitution Legislature will pass on legalizing prostitution in Las Vegas MOUND HOUSE — The brothel lobbyist always rings twice, George Flint explained as he shambled up the walkway to the Sagebrush Ranch, a scattering of bawdy houses in a cul-de-sac just 10 minutes from the Legislature. That way, the working girls know they don’t have to line up to primp for a paying customer. Inside, the small brothel is Nevada casino dark, tinged with red lighting. During Flint’s visit on a recent Wednesday afternoon, girls napped on couches and armchairs. One curled up under a red blanket. Another dangled her feet, in platform stiletto heels, over the arm of a chair. The brothel’s public room was empty of other men. Flint, 78, propped himself on a stool at the bar. A brunette and a blonde — Trinity and Star — sat beside him, taking advantage of a lull in business to sip sodas and watch true crime mysteries on television. Flint pulled out his business cards. He has two sets. One is for his job as brothel lobbyist: “Your insurance against the Legislature,” he told the girls. They nodded politely. “Thank you,” Trinity said, sticking out her hand for an awkward handshake. His second business card seems incongruous with his first. “And if you get married,” he said, handing them a card for his wedding chapel business. Yes, Flint is also a minister. “Oh! I just got engaged,” said Star, her face brightening. Flint is entering his 28th year as a uniquely Nevada political fixture: brothel lobbyist, wedding chapel owner, self-proclaimed mayor of the coffee shop at the Legislature and, perhaps most importantly, keeper of secrets. If Dennis Hof, the flamboyant owner of the Bunny Ranch and star of the HBO series “Cathouse,” is the brothel industry’s public face, Flint is its political girth, an accepted part of the Nevada legislative machine. Since the first Nevada “house of ill fame,” as they’re sometimes referred to in state law, was licensed in 1971, brothels have operated in low-slung “ranches” near industrial sites where wild mustangs graze. The businesses are residue of the state’s libertarian mining camp ethos. Flint — who wears glasses with lenses the size of baseballs and walks with a heavy limp caused by a 1975 car crash after a night of celebrating a legislative victory — is the man who represents them at the Legislature. Since becoming the industry’s lobbyist in 1985, he has cultivated a low profile for the industry and himself. He doesn’t walk around the Legislature with women on his arms. He rarely agrees to profiles. He believes a portion of the state will never be swayed by the legal industry’s argument. “You don’t want to rub this business too much in people’s faces,” Flint said. He then borrowed a line from former Speaker Joe Dini, a Democrat whose district was home to more than one brothel and who for years helped stop efforts to ban them: “Or as Dini liked to say, ‘Lie low in the brush.’” But for an industry that is only one bill away from annihilation, Flint has big plans — he hears the footsteps of time, and this might be his last session. He’s planning to take a run at the grandest date of all, the holy grail and great white whale of the brothel industry rolled into one: convincing lawmakers to allow legal prostitution in Clark County and Las Vegas. Technically, it’s a simple fix: Eliminate a state law that says only counties with fewer than 700,000 people can issue work cards to prostitutes and brothel owners. Then, the Clark County Commission would have to allow it. But Flint is inclined to make a more specific, major push in Clark County, the specifics of which he’s not ready to talk about yet. Politically, though, it’s a massive effort, and Flint is working it both at the state and county levels. While talking with a reporter in Carson City, Flint answered his ringing cellphone and offered a glimpse into the argument he’s making to policymakers. “Tom, we’re talking a huge amount of money here, and no one is getting any of it. ... We’re talking three locations to start with. ... He’s a good Baptist boy, but you have to get him to understand — it’s happening anyway. We’re not changing anything. We’re taking the stink out of it.” Tom, in this case, is Clark County Commissioner Tom Collins. In an interview later, Collins would say he was open to the idea of talking about legalizing and regulating prostitution in Clark County. “Does anyone think it’s not happening here?” Collins said the day after a prominent Las Vegas limousine company was indicted, in part, for operating as an illegal prostitution ring. ‘He could own this state’ Flint’s job as a lobbyist is traditional in many ways. He wanders the halls at the Legislature, chatting up lawmakers and other lobbyists in the hallways and holding court at the small dining commons in the middle of the first floor. He testifies at committee hearings and has been known to doze off once or twice, along with the best of them, while waiting for his turn at the microphone. And he hands out campaign checks to candidates — only one of which was returned this year, Flint said proudly. But by virtue of the industry he lobbies for, Flint also logs some fairly nontraditional duties — offering tours of Nevada’s houses of ill fame to gawking lawmakers and even handing out “freebie” visits to legislators with the women who work there. But things may be changing. The days when lawmakers would ask for passes to the brothels from Flint have quieted. For the first time, there were no requests last session, Flint said. Flint acknowledged he’d passed out a fair number of coupons to elected officials in his day. “I know enough to embarrass an awful lot of them, but I would never do it,” he said. (One of Flint’s colleagues in the lobbying core once said, “I could own this state if I knew half of what he does.”) Over the years, Flint has seen the industry change. He’s watched, sometimes uncomfortably, as it climbed slowly out of those obscure bushes in the state’s remote counties and onto cable television. There’s Hof, outspoken and master of free publicity. Flint bristled at Hof’s high profile, worried that the media attention would bring an effort to ban the legal industry. Lance Gilman, another brothel owner, was just elected to the Storey County Commission, bringing a new round of oh-my-gosh national media stories about the only state in the country where prostitution is legal. “Maybe this is a door opener; it allows a little more visibility of the industry,” Flint said. “We have nothing to be ashamed of and a lot to be proud of, in fact.” Flint’s reality: Men pay for sex Amid all of the moral and ethical issues surrounding prostitution, Flint’s reality is that men pay for sex. They’ve been doing so for thousands of years, and they’re still doing it today. Google "escort services." Do those women just enjoy conversation? Look at the pretty girl, by herself, slowly playing video poker at the casino bar, eager to chat up a middle-aged tourist. Look at the smut peddlers on the Strip, passing out girls-direct-to-your-room cards. Look at how Las Vegas has marketed itself to the world: “What happens here, stays here.” Leila Navidi A handbiller outside the Flamingo just north of Flamingo Road on the Strip passes out cards for an escort service in May 2010. “What do you think they’re talking about?” Flint asks, incredulous, as if having to explain how you know the world is round. “Losing money at the tables?” To Flint, the rest of the country — even Las Vegas — is living in denial. They’ve been playing with prohibition, decades after it proved it didn’t work with alcohol. Meanwhile, that naive approach has pushed the sex-for-money economy into the shadows. Underaged girls are trafficked. Pimps beat up women. Sexually transmitted diseases and HIV are spread. Money changes hands — $7 billion a year in Las Vegas, Flint estimates — to criminals as part of a dark economy. On prostitution, in Flint’s view, it’s a binary choice: illegal and dangerous or regulated and safe. From the pulpit to the brothel It wasn’t actually prostitution that first landed Flint in the Legislature. It was his job as a minister and wedding chapel owner. Flint was born April 12, 1934, in Southern California, in the harbor city of San Pedro. His parents were both preachers, ministering particularly to the Southern California Japanese-American community. When the United States shipped off the Japanese-Americans to internment camps in Wyoming during World War II, his parents moved with them to minister. Flint was in the fifth grade. Back then, there were brothels all over Wyoming, Flint said, maybe not legal, but tolerated and accepted. They were, Flint said, as prolific as Safeway stores. Flint was a sportswriter for his high school newspaper and would travel around the region with the football and boys' basketball teams. Brothels were sometimes stops on those trips. “I don’t know why, but I just accepted it as part of the life experience,” he said. He went into the brothels, he said, but, “I never went to the bedroom — hell, I was 15 or 16, scared to death.” The owners of one brothel, the Yellow Hotel, would come into his dad’s photo shop — his parents couldn’t afford to live on the modest salary the congregation paid — when they lived in Lusk. “My father had a terrible distaste for them because they were in prostitution,” Flint said. “My father also hated Harry Truman, and that’s what made me a Democrat.” But to Flint, the owners of the brothel, which he’d buy as a hotel years later, were “lovely people. Good businesspeople.” Flint’s mother, Grace Flint, was much more understanding. “She was elastic, middle of the road. ... She was much more tolerant of human frailties than my father was,” he said. After high school, Flint went to the College of the Open Bible in Des Moines, Iowa, where he studied theology for three years. He doesn’t know why he did it. “I was never motivated to go into the ministry,” he said. He ended up moving to Eugene, Ore. (Last month, the biblical school Flint attended for three years, now known as New Hope Christian College, wrote an article praising Flint for sending weekly checks to support the Grace Flint Memorial Library, totaling $100,000. The article didn’t mention his day job.) In 1961, married with four young kids, Flint visited his sister, who worked in a wedding chapel in Reno. They performed seven weddings in one day, and he saw a business. In the spring of 1962, he moved his family to Reno. With $1,600 borrowed from two banks, he started his own chapel. At that time, every other state but Nevada required either a waiting period before couples got married or a blood test. Nevada required neither, and Reno and Las Vegas were ready-made cheap honeymoon towns. Flint rented an old Victorian house in Reno and opened the Chapel of the Bells. Reading the newspaper during the 1963 legislative session, he started to get a bug. “It looked to me like we were on rocky ground,” he said of the chapel business. “We weren’t respected. The attitude was that we married runaway kids.” The evangelicals and the Catholics wanted the quickie-marriage industry gone. His first legislative war came in 1967, when Nevada’s church leadership tried to squash the wedding chapel business — which they regarded as irreverent competition, Flint said. To do it, Nevada church officials fronted a bill in the state Senate that would have declared couples married as soon as they picked up a marriage license — a move that would have essentially killed the quickie wedding chapel business. Local pastors came up and testified their support. Nye County Brothels Launch slideshow » Then it was Flint’s turn. Unbeknownst to the local pastors, Flint had called church officials at their out-of-state headquarters, including the Methodist, Catholic and Assembly of God leadership. When he took the microphone, Flint explained to lawmakers that the national church leaders thought the idea of marriage via certificate was “very unorthodox, very nontraditional.” In fact, he got the national leadership to say “that was the dumbest thing they ever heard of.” And he got them on tape. “It was a good bloodletting,” he said. Church leadership, after talking to the local pastors, claimed they were duped. “I wasn’t 100 percent honest,” Flint said. “I didn’t tell them I was with a chapel.” He was scolded by the lawmakers for his tactics, but the bill was dead. The industry was protected. Since then, Flint says, he has pretty well rewritten most of Nevada’s wedding laws, including taking justices of the peace out of the business. The great white whale In 1985, Flint received a message at the Legislature that led to his role as both wedding chapel minister and brothel lobbyist. A pair of brothel owners called him out to the Kit Kat Ranch, east of Carson City — in the same complex as the Sagebrush Ranch — for a meeting. "There’s a new disease out there, called AIDS," Flint remembers them saying. "A movie star, Rock Hudson, has it." And, they worried, “it could be the downfall of the industry.” They needed help keeping state lawmakers from trying to shut them down. Before taking the job, Flint wanted to make sure Joe Conforte, the most prominent brothel owner in town, was on board. Conforte, now living on the lam in Brazil from the federal government on tax charges, would become a close friend. Then Flint talked with Dini, a Democrat and leader of the Assembly. Dini blew up. “‘The last thing we need is a brothel lobbyist running up and down the hall,’” Flint recalled Dini shouting. Flint took the job anyway. Since then, he’s not only fought off efforts to abolish legal prostitution, but tried to further weave the industry into the state’s economic fabric. At least twice, he’s unsuccessfully worked to pass a state tax on prostitution, believing that lawmakers would never kill an industry on which it depended for money. Efforts in 2003 and 2009 failed because lawmakers felt the issue had become too big of a distraction for a relatively small amount of money. But in the 2013 Legislature, which starts in February, Flint said he’s going to make a run at more sweeping legislation. He said he has two lawmakers in the Assembly — whom he would not name — interested in “addressing the problem” of illegal prostitution in Clark County, by legalizing and regulating the industry. First, the lawmakers want a survey of voters in Clark County, from a respected pollster, to measure voters’ opinions on the subject. “I have to be very cautious,” Flint said. “Our intention over the next two months is to do a poll, stir up enough support in leadership, to at least take a shot at the issue.” Flint also said this might be his last session. “I’m dedicated to doing it in my lifetime,” he said. “I feel the lack of legalization and regulation in Clark County creates a huge amount of crime that needs to be addressed.” Plus, he estimated, it could bring in $300 million to $400 million in taxes for the county, city or state, every two years. While the proceeds from a sex act are now split 50-50 between the house and the working girl, Flint said he would propose a 40-40-20 split, with the government taking the low end. But to do it, he’ll have to overcome the state’s biggest industry: the casinos. Virginia Valentine, president of the Nevada Resort Association, which lobbies for most of the major casinos, said in a statement: “We do not condone the conduct of any illegal activity ... and would not support legalization” in Clark County. Billy Vassiliadis, a top lobbyist and marketer in Las Vegas — but not speaking on behalf of the Nevada Resort Association, in this case — said legalizing prostitution would damage the prestige of the Strip, where some of the highest-class resorts in the world have been built. “It is not consistent with what business travelers, convention delegates want,” he said. Guy Rocha, a state historian who has studied the legal brothel industry, said Flint’s quest was a long shot. No longer does Nevada lead the way in libertarian trailblazing, as it did with divorce, boxing, gambling and the marriage industry. Instead, other states have taken the lead on issues like legalized marijuana and gay marriage. Nevada, with its corporate-owned casinos, is more cautious. “Prohibition on sex for sale has failed, is a failure and will continue to be a failure,” he said. It’s just, “the state’s not ready for George Flint yet.” ‘It’s not totally not normal’ Flint admits his dual role as minister and brothel lobbyist is “incongruous.” “It was never planned,” he said. But he likes to bring up the Bible in defending the brothel industry. “People say, 'How can you, of all people, represent that industry?'” he said. Here he taps a reporter on the leg to emphasize the point. “Who was Jesus’ best friend? I think it was Mary Magdalene,” he said. Flint said the brothel industry “deserves the best protection and guidance and help just like any other industry. Just as an attorney would.” His second wife, Betty — to whom he has been married 44 years — and children are fine with his brothel lobbying, though he admits his wife sometimes gets irked when he shows friendship to some of the girls. Flint said he believes in monogamy and the sanctity of marriage. He’s just realistic. Has he ever been to a brothel? Of course, Flint said. He went out with a reporter the other day. Here’s what you really want to know: “If you’re asking if I’ve been to the bedroom? Yeah. I have.” Between his first and second marriages, in the 1960s, “I reached out for the solace and warmth of professionals,” he said. “I haven’t been to a bedroom in 30 years, maybe longer. When you get to be close to 80, your needs are different.” Brothel lobbyist George Flint testifies in committee on April 6, 2011, at the Legislature in Carson City. Years ago, at a forum, a woman accosted him. "Are you that George Flint?" she asked. "Yes," he said. “That … Mustang Ranch is a constant threat to my marriage,” she told him, inserting a profanity before the name of the establishment. “Hold on a minute, lady,” Flint said, before giving her advice. “Listen carefully. Go down to Walden Books and buy ‘Joy of Sex.’” Every night, he told her, take turns with your husband reading a few pages of the book out loud. Talk about your sexual desires, your sexual fears, your sexual inadequacies. “Do that, and you’ll never, ever have to worry about the Mustang Ranch,” he said. His point? By following Flint’s recommendation, the husband would never even consider going to a hooker. He repeated some advice he gives during the marriage ceremonies he performs: “Never quit listening to each other’s wants and needs.” But would Flint want one of his family members working in the brothel business? “I had one daughter who died in her late 40s of alcoholism. A lot of times, I think she’d have been better off at the Mustang Ranch,” he said, getting quiet. There are a lot of people living on the edge of society, he said. He wouldn't talk about it anymore. Flint revels in telling real-life “Pretty Woman” stories, about the prostitutes who’ve made it out — used sex work to bank cash so they could get an education, become a nurse or get a doctorate, or met a husband through work. But they don’t all end up that way. One of the women Flint introduced during an interview with the Sun has been working as a prostitute for two decades. She is now 50 years old and admitted she needed to find a new line of work. But what? Flint could sense a reporter’s uneasiness with the profession. But he justifies his quest for the spread of legalized prostitution with the knowledge that it is happening, regulated or not. “All day today, nothing I’ve told you — I’m not going to tell you this is totally normal,” he said finally. “But don’t think it’s totally not normal either.” 17 Comments Join the Discussion: Check this out for a full explanation of our conversion to the LiveFyre commenting system and instructions on how to sign up for an account.

Our Retreat Gallery Rates News Contact The Girlfriend Experience – Enjoy The Perfect GFE April 27, 2015 by Adley S. Tired of not getting the Girlfriend Experience you deserve? As a male, you pretty much have the keys to the western world in your back pocket. Hell, as a male you pretty much have the keys to the entire planet, should you choose to use them. I’m sure a great many of my fellow women are lining up right now to give me a few solid whacks on the head, so I’d like to balance out that less than politically correct truth by saying that as men you also have your fair share of sexism to deal with. For example, who decided that because you are ‘guys’ you should be comfortable peeing next to each other in public? Who decided that showing emotion was unmanly? Perhaps most importantly, who decided that you guys didn’t need romance and affection to be happy? Nowhere is gender politics cloudier than when it comes to sex. Those dastardly gender roles are still sitting proudly on their thrones, ensuring that all women want a cuddle after sex (not true) and that all men just want to roll over and go to sleep (also not true).  Men are expected to be animalistic – to crave it like beasts and to look at the whole process of sex as an emotionless, self-satisfying venture. Unfortunately, large parts of the adult entertainment industry and even the sex trade are geared toward this myth. This leaves many men who actually respond emotionally as well as physically to sex distinctly unsatisfied. Where do sensitive, intelligent guys go for a good time? If you’ve ever hired an escort for an evening, this ‘cut and dry’ attitude is brought into the spotlight.  In general, the providers you hire have strict rules against anything even remotely resembling emotional response. Sex is treated as a service no more intimate than a dental exam. What if you’re one of the growing number of successful men who use escorts and need a sense of intimacy to truly enjoy sex?  What if you actually need to kiss…hell, want to kiss in order to feel aroused. What if you want a back rub, to hold hands, to sit on the couch and make out like a teenager? Is that so wrong? Welcome to the Girlfriend Experience (GFE) More and more, successful men who don’t have the time or energy in their daily lives to pursue actual relationships are looking for escorts who excel in what is known in the industry as a GFE. Unlike traditional interactions where sex and money is exchanged with equal detachment, escorts who excel at GFE will give their clients a real relationship experience for the time that they are hired for. What does this mean? Think of all the good parts of being in a relationship and then take away the commitment, the silly fights and the need to take her home to meet your parents. Women who provide this service to their clients will take the time to get to know them, have full conversations, hold hands, kiss (with tongue!), cuddle and even spend the night. For men who respond better to intimacy and affection, finding an escort who excels at the Girlfriend Experience is like stumbling across the Holy Grail. Getting the most out of your GFE One of the best things about a girlfriend experience is the fact that both provider and client enjoy the interaction much more. Professional escorts with a roster of clients who ask for this brand of experience rate their level of job satisfaction much higher than those who provide traditional, interactions. They are treated with respect, they are listened to and they are showered with the kind of attention that both men and women crave from each other. Although any professional who excels at GFE will know what to do to ‘set the tone’, there are things that you can do to enhance your experience as well.  Like any woman, she will respond to you much better if you take the time to ask her questions about herself and really listen to her responses.  Yes she is a paid professional, but she is human and wants to be heard. Along the same lines, you should consider giving her a gift or two the more time you spend with her.  This doesn’t mean picking up some flowers at a local gas station either. When you actually get to know her, choose a thoughtful gift that relates to her interests and one that will impress a woman who makes the kind of substantial income she no doubt does. Unlike most escort/ client interactions, the girlfriend experience generally includes deep French kissing, oral sex for men and women as well as intercourse and even anal depending on the provider. When it comes to kissing – let her lead the way.  Kissing is a touchy area for escorts and being the gentleman you are by allowing her to take the upper hand will be greatly appreciated. The same goes for oral. Some providers include BBBJ (bare back blow jobs i.e./unprotected oral) as part of the girl friend experience but don’t assume this is the case with your chosen companion.  Always be prepared and as previously mentioned…let her lead.  Allowing her to gain confidence and trust in you will truly bring out the ‘girlfriend’ in her and make for a much more satisfying experience for both of you. Once you’ve found the perfect girlfriend experience, it can grow into a beautiful arrangement. Why not invite her on a resort weekend? Whisk her away for a tropical holiday? Yes, you’ll be paying for her company but one of the most marvelous things about it is that when you part ways, there are no complications to drag either of you down. You owe each other nothing but respect and mutual enjoyment when you are together. It is truly the ideal situation for any busy man with no desire for commitment, but the basic human need for companionship. Just like your chosen escort is not an inhuman sex robot, you are not some kind of heartless 1950’s stereotype. In the same way that she deserves respect, you deserve to have your needs met in a way that doesn’t make you feel like you don’t warrant real human interaction. If you are the girlfriend experience kind of guy, there is an entire world of fulfillment waiting for you.  Just grab an expensive bouquet of flowers, put your listening ears on and get out there!

On Survival So Long, Gawker, Thanks For the Coverage and the Bylines Dear Tits and Sass: Boundaries Tits and Sass Nevada’s Brothels: Legalization Serves The Man by Bella Mansfield, Esq. on April 22, 2014 · 37 comments in Labor Law, Prostitution via Flickr user Craig Walkowicz One of the many questions OkCupid users can answer to determine compatibility with potential mates is “Should prostitution be legal?” The answer options are: Yes, absolutely Yes, only if it were regulated I don’t think so ABSOLUTELY NOT (emphasis theirs) In my four years of using the site, I’ve noticed that those who choose answer “2” frequently add something in the comments about regulations being necessary to protect workers from harm. Somewhat less frequently someone comments that regulations protect the health and general well-being of the public. My sample size is, of course, limited, but that thinking isn’t all that different from members of the general public who support legalization. Legalization, the thinking goes, would protect the public from the perceived health risks associated with prostitution by mandating testing, provide states with tax money (which relies on the false assumption that sex workers don’t currently pay taxes) and would control when and where sex work could be done. And, if prostitution was legal, sex workers would be safer because they would feel more comfortable utilizing the criminal legal system. What they forget is that we have an example of legal prostitution in the United States: regulated, licensed brothels in the state of Nevada. While legalization provides benefits to the state, the workers are still treated as second-class citizens. Nevada has been home to brothels since the late 1800s, and the first licensed brothel opened there in 1971. Currently, there is no statute explicitly stating that prostitution is legal, but under state law, counties in Nevada with populations under 400,000 can allow brothels. These brothels are the only places in the United States where one can engage in legal prostitution, and the people doing this work are governed by three different sets of regulations: state laws, county laws and brothel rules.1 While the state laws are easy to access and review, county laws are less so, and brothel rules are not available to the public. The small size of the counties and towns that the brothels are in means that rules frequently change depending on the mood of the sheriff. This form of legalization is a combination of modern business law and Wild West attitudes. Nevada state laws are the framework under which the counties containing brothels operate. They dictate where brothels (or “houses of ill fame” as the law describes them) can be located, the steps counties must follow in order to have legal brothels, advertising restrictions, and health regulations. They not only establish behavioral and structural regulations, but also include statutes requiring workers to be tested weekly for gonorrhea and chlamydia (through a cervical sample) and monthly for HIV and syphilis (through a blood test). A positive test result for any of these mean that the worker must quit working in a legal brothel. If a worker tests positive for HIV and continues working, they can be charged with a class B felony, and if the brothel owner knows of their test results they are liable if anyone contracts HIV from that worker. While it can vary by county, the fees for the tests are usually paid for by the worker. Condoms are mandatory for oral sex and intercourse. In order to further protect the health of clients, some counties place restrictions on how long a worker can be gone from a brothel before she has to be re-tested or require a chaperone if a worker goes out at night, lest she work independently and choose to not use a condom. There are also strict laws regarding pandering beyond the typical “pimping” statutes that might come to mind. Living off the proceeds of prostitution is pandering, so workers’ spouses and partners better have their own employment! Providing transportation so that someone can engage in prostitution is also illegal. The transportation statute essentially prohibits anyone from providing a worker with a ride to work, as it finds that anyone transporting a worker with the intent to encourage them in engaging in prostitution is guilty of pandering. This is an interesting contrast to the policies that some brothels have of giving a fee to cab drivers who bring clients to their establishments or providing free limo service to clients coming from Las Vegas. While workers either have to drive themselves to work or find a ride with someone who doesn’t know what they do, clients can arrive in business-sponsored cars. Few things show intent to encourage someone to hire a prostitute more than sending a complimentary limo to whisk them away to a brothel. State law also restricts advertising for both legal brothels and illegal prostitution. Brothels can only advertise in the counties where prostitution is legal. It’s also illegal to prepare or print an advertisement for illegal prostitution, which means that graphic designers, handbill printers and producers of small newsprint ad catalogs are now included in the category of people who are affected by the prohibition of sex work. The penalty for illegal advertising can include jail time and fees. via Flickr user DB’s travels County laws regulate the actual license application process, fees, and zoning for brothels. They also include worker-specific statutes, like those governing work cards. Any employee at a brothel, including bartenders, must have a work card. In Storey County, home of the Mustang Ranch, workers must submit all previous addresses for the last three years, aliases, a criminal background check release, and a medical release form allowing the medical facilities and/or doctors to share her test results with the county. A work card can be denied for myriad reasons, including a conviction for petty theft or shoplifting in the last year or a drug-related misdemeanor conviction within the last three years. In addition to state and county regulations, each brothel has its own set of rules. These rules aren’t available to the public, but there is an in-depth discussion of the rules at the Mustang Ranch in Alexa Albert’s book Brothel.2 Workers there must pay a rooming and food fee, and are required to stay at the brothel for a minimum of two weeks. While staying at the brothel, workers can only leave for medical exams (although there is also an option of seeing a doctor on site) or for special emergencies. Should they need something, like a toothbrush or a box of tampons, they must pay a fee to a house runner who will pick up these items for her. Workers negotiate their own fee with clients, often varying by which sex acts are going to be performed, and they have a 50/50 split with the house. They are also expected to tip the bartender, security workers and other staff. If they leave, they must return by a set curfew. Albert reported in her book that workers could not live or vacation in the town where they worked, but I did not find any Storey County statutes stating such. The result of this kind of legalization is a system that benefits the state, county governments and brothel owners tremendously. The worker benefits in that she does not risk arrest (or at least not for prostitution, as she can still be arrested for violating a state or county regulation) and there is an assumption of safety. I would be interested to see statistics of rape and coercion in legal brothels versus incidents of the same with independent escorts. My suspicion is that legal brothels are not necessarily markedly safer than doing indoor prostitution illegally. Legalization, at least under the Nevada model, means submitting to mandated testing and the county having access to those test results. It means paying fees to the county but also to the brothel. It means staying inside for long stretches of time and having restrictions placed on your movement, including during non-work weeks. It means you might be denied a work card if you’ve been convicted of not only violent offenses but also survival crimes, like shoplifting. This model is not pro-worker, but pro-government, pro-customer and pro-business owner. One hopes that most workers get tested regularly for sexually transmitted infections, but it should be the worker’s choice when and how her body is subjected to tests and the results should be between herself and her doctor.3 While Nevada does have a criminal statute making it illegal to knowingly transmit HIV to another person, there are no regulations surrounding the health of those who wish to purchase sex at brothels. The fees, both for work cards and within the brothels, place the county alongside the brothel owner in the role of madam. Workers are asked to trade autonomy over their movements and submit to medical testing for a removed risk of arrest, and the county and brothel owners get to profit in return. This is not an acceptable alternative to criminalization. On paper, these laws and rules appear to be incredibly restrictive, invasive and to the benefit of the government far more than the worker. It is also a system that may target workers with less resources. Independent workers who have access to screening tools and community can take their chances with working for themselves in cities where prostitution is illegal. Women who don’t have easy access to ways to stay safe might more frequently choose the comfort of knowing that they are engaging in a legal trade, and the state gets the cash reward for providing them with that option. A more worker-friendly alternative is decriminalization of prostitution and prostitution-related offenses. Decriminalization would remove or significantly reduce criminal penalties, but would not create regulations the way that legalization would. Reducing jail or probation time to a ticket or fine—or eliminating penalties altogether—would still allow the worker to control personal aspects of her business without risking arrest. Nevada is just one example of how legalization could work, and at best it is a hodgepodge of regulations. If this was the model for legal sex work in the United States—if even just a few of their laws became standard—sex workers would lose much of their independence of movement and communication to laws created by people who don’t know even basic information about the industry, like the fact that sex workers in the U.S. are a safer bet, health-wise, than a one-night stand from a bar. Until there is a model of legalization that focuses on keeping workers safe, decriminalization is the better option. 1. A note about language: there are many people who work in brothels who are not prostitutes. However, for the purposes of this article, when I write “worker” I mean prostitute unless otherwise indicated.↩ 2. This book was published in 2002. The rules stated here may have changed since the book’s publication.↩ 3. This is an excellent example of how laws that affect sex workers are often part of bigger systemic oppression. Requiring workers to agree to testing and sharing their results in exchange for being allowed to work is the medicalization of the female worker. Laws that require transgender people to have a certain set of surgeries in order to change the gender marker on their birth certificate and programs that offer benefits or money only to female drug users who agree to be sterilized are other examples of removing medical autonomy from marginalized groups in trade for greater access to privilege.

Fighting for total decriminalization sounds great on paper, but it will be infinitely more difficult to accomplish than legalization. They are finding that out in Colorado now with legalized pot where they accepted the regulation as the cost of making pot legal. If you wish to be recognized as being a legitimate profession then, when you get your wish, be prepared to be treated as other legitimate businesses are treated. There will be health requirements, financial regulation, inspections, and new taxes. Of course, most of these regulations are unnecessary because, like all businesses, you already have a powerful incentive to please your customers. Your livelihood, health, and well being depend on it. Unfortunately, regulation is what politicians do, what the media fear mongers promote, and the public expects. Good luck with your cause. Criminalization of sex work is a national disgrace for a country that calls itself “the land of the free”.

Reply Jeremy Lemur April 22, 2014 at 7:55 pm “One hopes that most workers get tested regularly for sexually transmitted infections, but it should be the worker’s choice when and how her body is subjected to tests and the results should be between herself and her doctor.” What the author is saying is that she prefers a system without standards and accountability. The Nevada model is as strict as it needs to be in order to establish an “industry standard” for sex work that ensures the safety and health of courtesans and customers. Yes, sex workers in Nevada Brothels have to be tested, and if they have an STD or HIV, they are not permitted to work. Yes, sex workers must pay fees to get their business license and Sheriff card – they’re independent contractors working at legitimate businesses. Yes there are county laws, state laws, and, like all workplaces, there are rules. Welcome to being a recognized member of civilized society. We don’t raise our arms in protest when we have to go to the DMV and pay for our car to be registered. We don’t feel violated because the DMV requires our birth certificate to validate our identity – and we don’t think that the vision test required to drive a car should be private information between us and our eye doctor. Standards are necessary to legitimize a service or privilege. Nevada Brothels have been operating legally for nearly half a century now. The Nevada model is an excellent example of how prostitution can work in a legalized setting and benefit customers, business owners, and sex workers by providing a safe, healthy, and lucrative environment through the enforcement of time-tested quality and operational standards. Like all things created by humans, it’s not perfect, but it’s a gigantic step in the right direction for legitimizing the sex work industry. Reply Evie April 23, 2014 at 3:48 pm If you had actually read the article, you’d understand why the Nevada model does NOT benefit actual sex workers, just their customers and anyone who makes a profit off of their labor. So, not much different than the criminalization model everywhere else in the US. And I’ll get a weekly cervical swab if my customer gets a weekly urethral swab. It’s not real accountability if only one side is held accountable. Reply Amanda April 23, 2014 at 5:10 pm Everyone who supports the testing model of the NV brothels not only fails to realize that weekly testing isn’t a best practice, but that diseases are brought into brothels via the clients. If anyone should be tested, it should be the clients. (As the author of the article pointed out.) Not to mention, not all diseases that could be tested for are. So what’s the point? Some diseases are okay, others aren’t??? Why test at all? “Like all things created by humans, it’s not perfect, but it’s a gigantic step in the right direction for legitimizing the sex work industry.” No, it’s not a step in the right direction. The brothels have been around for 50 years, as you say, and yet the strides made in legitimizing sex work have come from non-brothel sex worker activists. The brothels aren’t fond of sex worker rights and do not want to help legitimize the industry because it means they lose control and lose money. Far more perfect is the New Zealand model, where independent sex workers are treated as independent women quietly leading their own lives, which is pretty much the same as any single woman on the dating scene. Brothels are treated as businesses and it’s the establishments themselves (and management) which are regulated as a business, not the women’s bodies. Reply Jeremy Lemur April 23, 2014 at 8:02 pm Hi Amanda, Regarding your comment: “Far more perfect is the New Zealand model, where independent sex workers are treated as independent women quietly leading their own lives, which is pretty much the same as any single woman on the dating scene. Brothels are treated as businesses…” See, this is the thing that gets me. You ARE NOT single women on the dating scene. You ARE service providers performing a spectacular service to a paying client. YOU, Amanda, ARE a business when functioning as a prostitute. Yes, brothels are treated as businesses, because that’s what they are: businesses where the business of sex work performed by independent women legally takes place. Reply Robin D April 23, 2014 at 11:16 pm Brothels are businesses. Amanda or whoever would be a freelancer or in New Zealand, if incall, a “Small Owner Operated Brothel,” which, yeah, would mean she is not subject to all of the same laws, though still subject to some. Dating scene was probably the wrong phrase but different laws do apply to businesses with employees (I know they are classified as independent contractors in Nevada but this is illegal under federal labor law and the brothels would lose a lawsuit like the strip clubs do). Nobody in New Zealand is forced to be tested. They also do not have to register with the police though brothel operators must be registered at an administrative law level. Brothels are subject to zoning and advertising bylaws. This works really well! Really, really well. Way less invasive and way more effective than the system in Nevada. There are health regulations – for sex workers and clients to use and promote safe sex, which is as it should be, not mandated testing. The financial regulations and taxes are the same as before. Which, it’s also true in the US that sex workers are subject to those regulations already, as they are enforced separately from the prostitution laws. Reply Amanda April 25, 2014 at 9:03 am Thank you for clarifying the finer points Robin! Robin D April 25, 2014 at 1:45 pm You’re welcome Amanda! I think the biggest point is no forced testing…and no evidence of transmissions, either. Also of note that street work is not outlawed but is also subject to zoning I think – sometimes this pushes sex workers into less safe (e.g. more industrial) areas, but I think I remember that maybe this worked better than that in NZ? Scarlet Heart April 23, 2014 at 11:32 pm This guy: “I’m not in the sex industry, but I’m going to tell you all what’s best for you because being a man my opinion is superior to all your lived experiences put together!” Reply Jeremy Lemur April 24, 2014 at 12:49 pm I work on staff, full time, at a legal Nevada brothel, obviously not as a prostitute. My opinion (man or not) has a some validity as a person who devotes every day of his life to the sex work industry. Scarlet, your comment about me being a man is indicative of the worst aspects of this usually excellent site. Amanda April 24, 2014 at 8:58 am Jeremy — Don’t tell me what I am, let me determine that for myself. Having sex with a client is no different (from a disease-transmission perspective) than having sex with a civilian. Money doesn’t prevent or cause disease. Testing doesn’t prevent a disease, neither does working for an establishment vs working on my own. Safer sex practices can prevent disease and I don’t need to work for a pimp to be able to put on a condom. Reply marissa April 25, 2014 at 1:45 am Preach! Why can’t most laypeople see the simplicity and common sense of it all? Random anonymous bar hookups, even Tinder, Grinderr etc are MORE sketchy than meeting a John who gives his credit card/traceable phone number, or goes through the various screening hurdles of internet escorting. John Punter April 22, 2014 at 10:27 pm Obviously brothels are a stupid idea. Forcing a sex worker to have a pimp is beyond dumb. Best case, a pimp provides security, something that sex workers should get from police and/or professional body guards. Sex workers can hire promoters if they need and want them. I don’t think, typically, there is anything illegal about, say, doing taxes or reading palms from a place that’s zoned as a residence. If someone did sex work from a residence, the usually zoning ordinances about signs, customer parking, etc. should handle that just fine. I suppose you could make a case for a law against paid, unprotected sex. But trying to protect people from their own stupidity always seems to end up being a wasted effort, however good the intentions. Reply Scarlet Heart April 23, 2014 at 12:41 am I have heard nothing but negative things about the Nevada brothels. As someone who does both brothel and independent escort work I feel lucky to be in Australia, where the only rules for working in a parlour (for the most part)are going for an interview, telling the manager what shifts you want and turning up, working, then going home. It differs slightly from state to state – like in Victoria where it is more regulated – but generally it is quite relaxed in comparison to the utter bullshit you have to go through to work in Nevada. It would not surprise me if a lot of the girls who work at those brothels take their clients for private bookings, risk of arrest be damned. Unfortunately many non-sws I know think the key is legalisation, it seems to be the prevailing attitude of the community. :/ Reply Amanda April 23, 2014 at 10:05 am I’ve been using the NV brothel model as a reason why legalization doesn’t work because it doesn’t truly benefit the worker. Sure, there are girls who can make tons of money in it, but most don’t. I had a very negative experience in a legal brothel. All the reasons you list, and then some, are why legalization doesn’t work. Plus, I had the joys of having my prostitution registration come up anytime a NV cop ran my license. You can imagine how much fun it is to sit on the side of the road, wondering if you’re lucky enough to get a cool cop who has seen it all before — or not. Yes, rape and coercion happens in the brothels. I heard some stories, I experienced a small bit of coercion from the house. Every room has a panic button. Brothels are not the safe-zone everyone makes them out to be — though it really depends on the brothel. On the other hand, the violence isn’t nearly as high as it is for independent workers — if you take a look at the overall numbers and not at specific individuals or brothels. Yet another problem with the brothel system you never touched on is the independent contractor status accorded to the women working there who are actually treated exactly like employees. This allows the brothels to continue to rip the women off, without providing compensation such as insurance, worker’s comp or other legal niceties. Being “legal” doesn’t confer any truly beneficial “legal” status in the workplace, something which is very, very lopsided. Brothels certainly don’t seem to conform to any sort of OSHA standards — which leads back around to the fact that rape and screwing around with a girl’s money can happen in some brothels but not others. The brothel system as it currently stands is very broken and only benefits the owners and the state. Why would anyone want to work for pimps like that? Dave — you’re one of those men who think you’re oh-so-well-meaning and so much smarter than us by telling us what we should and shouldn’t be doing for ourselves. We’ve heard your argument before, countless times. I don’t know what you’ve been doing to advance sex worker rights, but we’ll pursue decrim if that’s how we want the laws we live under structured, thank you very much. Reply Evie April 23, 2014 at 4:06 pm Re: independent contractors being treated like employees. Absolutely, and it’s the same situation in American strip clubs. Some are better than others, but I’ve never worked in a club that treated me like anything but an employee. My current place gives us a lot of flexibility in terms of schedule but we still have to pay that house fee, and late fees, tip outs for CRs, etc, are decided on the whims of whoever is managing that night, and how they feel about you. Strippers are also at risk for arrest, in my state an undercover cop can buy a lap dance, say you “offered or implied” sex for money, and his word is enough to get you charged with solicitation. Working inside legally may lower your risk of certain types of violence and abuse but you are still incredibly vulnerable and easy to exploit. Reply Amanda April 24, 2014 at 9:02 am I’d love if brothel workers sued the brothels or tried to unionize, but the pimps running the brothels have done a very good job of squelching any initiative for better working conditions or recognition of their legal status as employees. Reply Robin D April 23, 2014 at 7:59 pm Right?!!??? Actually neither is politically feasible in Colorado right now, so any change is going to have to be change that we MAKE politically feasible. In 2011, 32% thought it should be legal and 56% illegal, about the opposite of the numbers around marijuana. This holds true across party lines. They legally require an escort license too, already, but also can arrest you for prostitution. Some of us realize that you have to play the long game and chip away at criminalization from the bottom up. Also, that regulations should apply to businesses, not workers, and shouldn’t be more onerous than regular zoning laws and so on. Though I think the Nevada brothels have the right idea with the mandatory condom use (but not the testing). Curfews, shutting workers in, none of that is stuff that would be legal for any other business. Classifying employees as independent contractors like they do already isn’t, under labor law. But like the strip clubs they probably prefer the risk of a lawsuit in the current climate because it’s cheaper for them in aggregate. Should we have extra taxes? Would that help politically? Sure, maybe. But a ballot measure like Amendment 64 sure as shit isn’t going to be sufficient in any kind of near term. Reply Robin D April 23, 2014 at 8:02 pm Also, yeah – demands without contributing anything, that’s suuure familiar. Go start your own organizations or campaign. Hell get a measure on the ballot! It won’t pass, but it would get publicity and a chance to make the case for rights. Reply Kora April 24, 2014 at 3:23 am I work at a brothel, and this article is filled with inaccuracies. It also should not pretend to speak for all sex workers. It certainly doesn’t speak for me. The brothel doesn’t serve “the man,” it serves my wallet and my safety and security. I am for full decrim, full stop. HOWEVER, I really wish that independent escorts would stop shitting on brothel workers. You are no better or worse than us, and believe it or not, some sex workers (such as myself who have been on both sides of the fence, indie versus brothel work) PREFER brothel work. Indie work isn’t for everyone. Brothel work isn’t for everyone. How about advocating for the rights and choices of ALL sex workers, rather than just the ones in your inner circle? I really wish other sex workers would stop speaking for each other. Does the author even work at a brothel? Doubtful. Did she even interview any actual brothel workers? This is just more of the same crap that this site churns out. Why am I even surprised? Reply Caty Simon April 24, 2014 at 11:23 am Hey, it wasn’t Tits and Sass’ intention to shit on brothel workers, just brothel owners.

Once again, this site seems to be dedicated to shitting on sex workers who don’t do it the way the Marxist Feminist Tits and Sass crowd wants it done. Newsflash- your voices are no more or less important than other sex workers, including those who work in brothels. Reply Robin D April 24, 2014 at 3:18 pm You should take Caty up on her offer to write a counterpoint about your own experience (though obviously some of this varies brothel-to-brothel). I know one woman with a positive brothel experience and a whole bunch of horror stories from others… Anyway I don’t think most people are opposed to brothel work in general, but would prefer a brothel system more like those in New Zealand and New South Wales. Reply Amanda April 25, 2014 at 9:17 am I did work for a brothel for a very brief period of time and it was an eye-opening experience, to say the least. I’ve known a number of sex workers who do and do not like working in the brothels. Some of them have worked independently and some never have. The system as it currently stands is very broken and needs serious reform with the input of the workers. I’ve never advocated for ending the brothels because I recognize it’s a valid choice for many workers, especially in a criminalized country. That doesn’t mean the system couldn’t be improved. After all, it’s a legal system and therefore should be easier to improve than efforts to decriminalize, right? Giving half my money off the top to someone else is working for a pimp, IMO. Paying room and board is no different than touring independently but there is no sensible reason for the brothel to take half my earnings other than it was a system created by men living off the earnings of sex workers. Not to mention I get zero legal employee benefits for this money when, by all rights, I should be counted as an employee. The system rips off the women working in it and no, I don’t think it’s right — my sympathy is for the women. I guess that makes me a Marxist? Reply John Punter April 26, 2014 at 1:12 am There is nothing inherently bad about a sex worker having a pimp. It’s just that most pimps focus on taking advantage of the fact that sex workers are outcasts, rather than really earning their keep with security and promotion services. In that sense, NV brothels have a resemblance to pimps. The brothels extract more money than they need to, a create onerous working conditions, because they know sex workers have so few options. The point is not that there is anything wrong with feeling that NV brothels are the least bad among the current bad options for sex workers. The point of the article is that consenting adults should just be able to have at it. Brothels don’t meet the standard for the proper approach to government regulation in a free society. The standard being that people should be able to use there own judgement, unless there is factual evidence that government-imposed limitations are needed. Reply Caty Simon April 26, 2014 at 6:16 am There’s nothing wrong with a sex worker having an EMPLOYER or an EMPLOYEE, both roles which the different sorts of people called “pimps” have filled. Sex workers should be able to be employed or employ, just like any other worker and/or small business owner. But as you say, one of the reasons people filling those roles for sex workers have been called “pimps” is that the labor contracts many sex workers have with both licit and illicit employers have been grossly unfair. Reply Amanda April 26, 2014 at 9:55 am Caty and John — Both excellent points. I have no problem with support staff hired by the choice of the sex worker. Witness the many screening and marketing assistants now online. There are agencies that I wouldn’t have minded working for because they’ve gotten such good feedback from the women working for them, but they are rare.There’s only one US brothel I have heard good things about from a sex worker I trust. The “pimp” remark I make about brothels is because management seems determined to make money at any cost, regardless of the well-being of their employee; and they work as hard as possible to scrape as much off their employees as they can. The attitude isn’t treating the women like true employees or even like human beings, hence “pimp.” I understand that creating an underground economy by criminalizing prostitution leaves the door wide open for exploitation. Seeing the same exploitation, state-sanctioned and legalized, is reprehensible on many levels. Change is needed. If it’s supposed to be the “best” option, then make it the best option. John Punter April 29, 2014 at 12:57 am I wouldn’t disagree with you. What I posted previously was offensive to Kora, as someone who chose to work at an NV brothel because it was the best option available. There may be sex workers who give money to someone they feel they are getting some kind of support from, but it’s more complicated than any “standard” business relationship. I would want to listen to why they choose to do that before forming any definite opinion. It’s a problem how society can’t accept sex work as just another way of making a buck, a reasonable choice for some people. But we don’t want any new shaming creeping in place of the old. The plan of many sex workers is to work 100 days or less a year, pay their bills, and have a few splurges. Not crazy or dumb, just maybe encourage them to think a bit about the eventual “exit strategy”. It’s more worrisome when it seems like someone is using someone else. Could it be there are non-violent pimps out there, who are filling a need with similarities to the need sex workers sometimes fill for lonely johns? Of course, they would not be pimps if “pimp” has no non-pejorative sense. I think there are a lot of problems with sex workers being employees. For example, someone I’ve been seeing a lot of lately hates being touched on the sides of her head. It’s just in the nature of it that you have to be the one making the rules. Olivia Howard April 26, 2014 at 3:00 pm There are many things inherently bad and wrong about pimps. I’m defining pimps as someone that is exploitative lives off of the backs of women not legitimate agency owners that take 20% or less and handle all the screening, advertising through the agency owner’s client list and the internet. The distinction is important. Women that work for an agency are free to leave any time and are not treated as chattel and otherwise controlled by a pimp. These women working at these so-called brothels are being exploited, restricted, controlled and stolen from by the brothel owners, and, more importantly, it’s sanctioned by the local governments. It’s disgusting and appalling. Indy women do not need “security” or “promotion”. All an independent escort needs is access to the internet and a phone and they can perform these supposed pimp “services”. Most screening is done to ensure the client isn’t law enforcement not to determine if they are dangerous. Good screening techniques can be found in online books (Amanda Brook’s “The Internet Escort’s Handbook 1: The Foundation” is an excellent example) and in blogs like mine (www.hookerincorporated). Women can promote themselves by advertising on local review boards, Eros.com, Preferred411.com, My Red Book.com and The Erotic Review.com. There is literally NO reason any woman to pay anyone for alleged protection or to act as a promoter unless they choose to pay an agency owner a reasonable fee for a legitimate service. The WHOLE point is that there is something socially and morally wrong with the Nevada brothels laws and regulations. It’s thinking like this that allows women to be basically held captive and submit to medical examinations that may or may not be given with good will. There is literally NO reason at all for government sanctioned business like these to exist. Prostitution should be decriminalized and that’s the end of it. It’s no one’s business what a woman does with her body. The important issue is that people aren’t exploited and are allowed to earn a living as they see fit, and that’s not happening in these brothels or anywhere in the US. Reply Clare April 29, 2014 at 5:35 am So when it comes to sex works, Tits and Sass is espousing the libertarian view of “no regulation” at all? Good to know. Reply Caty Simon April 29, 2014 at 5:28 pm Decriminalization, actually. The New Zealand system. Look it up. Not “no regulation at all,” and certainly not nec. libertarian in spirit, but similar regulations as other businesses, not draconian government overregulation specifically for the sex industry.

But newbies who decide to find and date an escort realize there are some unanticipated pitfalls and landmines with escorts. Some of the things they start to realize: Your challenge with escorts is to avoid the pitfalls. I have the best answers and solutions. What if she is a cop? Can I get arrested? What if she robs me or her pimp beats me up? Why is she asking me for my employment information? Why do I get hung up on? When do I give her the money? When these thoughts start to enter your mind, you realize that the world of escorts is more complicated than you originally thought. Well, I’m here to demystify this world and help you find an escort who will satisfy your sexual fantasies and needs. There are five simple steps to dating an escort: Finding a good escort Preparing to call her Calling her Preparing for your date Dating her ***Btw, if you have a specific question or issue, email me at “jj@beginnerescortguide.com and I’ll try to answer it as soon as I can***   Step 1 – Find an escort who you are attracted to AND who is a good provider Finding the “RIGHT” escort for you at the outset is the most important step of the process This step is the most important in the process. Selecting a good escort will make the remaining steps a lot easier. Obviously, selecting a bad escort will make the following steps hell, and perhaps unrecoverable. Click here for an in-depth, detailed explanation on how to find an escort. But here are the basics. You must first look at where escorts advertise. The largest sites are: Backpage.com CityVibe.com Eros.com There could be smaller regional sites in your area (and they are good resources if they exist), but the larger sites are a good place to start. When looking at the postings, you’ll quickly find escorts who you are attracted to. But you also want to look out for possible scam escorts. Here are some warning signs to look for: If her picture is “too good to be true”, she probably is, but not always. Good research will reveal the truth. Studio pictures – this sometimes (not always) indicates that it could be a bait and switch, where the picture is not really her Multiple listings – if her listing exist in multiple cities, this could indicate a scam If you are still concerned about your selection, here is an advanced strategy for verifying if she is a good escort or not .   Step 2: Get prepared for your call I cannot stress this enough: the purpose of the call is to set your appointment, nothing else. A common newbie mistake is asking her questions about different sex acts during your phone call. This is a huge no-no. And if she is an undercover cop, you’re heading down an easy road of getting arrested. For the quick, professional advise on how to NEVER get arrested, click here.   Before calling the escort, you’ll want to get three things ready: Research Date, time, length, and venue of the appointment References   Research Proper research is essential not just to protect yourself and to get the woman you want, but also to secure a date with her too. Not being prepared will jeopardize your changes with her (and most escorts). Research as much as you can about your chosen woman. Most good escorts will have a website with general information and answers to commonly asked questions. With her ad, along with her website, you should find most of your questioned answered. If you want to take an advanced approach, check with review sites for reviews of her from your fellow hobbyists. There many review sites out there, but one specific site is better than the rest. Click here for a video on exactly how I used this review sites to find an escort.   Date, time, length, and venue of the appointment You should know the when and where of your preferred appointment, and a few alternate times if your first choice is not available. The more open your schedule is, the more likely it is that you’ll get an appointment. Also, time is one of the elements determines the cost of the appointment. The average date is 1 hour, although spending an evening with each other is typically very enjoyable with higher end escorts. The other two elements that determines cost is how beautiful she is and the “level of service” she provides. If you want more detailed knowledge, download my “Expected Cost Guide”. I also give a video explanation of the various cost of escort donation fees. Download it here.     References Being prepared to get verified is one of the key things to getting an appointment. But if you are a newbie with no references, this can be a challenge. But there are ways to overcome it. This is one that tends to throw off newbies. When an escort asks for references, they are looking for one (or two) of these three things: 1) two escorts that you’ve seen in past, 2) employment information, or 3) verification credentials. Obviously if you are a newbie, you will not have two escort references. That means you’re down to either employment information, or verification credentials. The reason why escorts will screen you is because they want to make sure you are not a serial killer or psycho. Verification is one method women will use to protect themselves. Click here for detailed advice on escort verification sites.   Step 3: Making the call Being calm, cool, confident, and collected is my #1 tip and strategy when calling an escort. When calling her, treat her like one of your buddies, but keep your call short. If you’d like to see a video on how a gentleman called an escort, click here. Calling an escort is where the rubber hits the road. Again, I cannot stress enough, the purpose of the call is to set the appointment, nothing else. If you’ve prepared yourself enough, this should be quite simple. Call her, get the appointment, and get off the phone. My best recommendation for this is to treat her as if she was one of your friends or buddies. Use a calm, casual, confident voice. Then get the appointment and get off the phone. Try to make the phone call reasonably short. Do not try to engage her into a conversation, and do not ask her questions that you should already know the answer to. Check out this video on how a gentleman called an escort. He did some things right, but also made some mistakes. Click here to watch the video. Two-Call System The two-call system applies to incall situations (you are going to her). Most escorts will not give you their exact location in your first phone call. Rather, they will give you an approximate location, like major cross streets. When you get close to their location, you call them again stating that you are arriving, and this is typically where they give you their exact location. Sometimes, it may be even a three-call system. In your second call, she may give you the hotel she is staying at, but she may not give you her room number until you actually arrive. Accept the information she gives you in the initial phone calls. Do not force her to give an exact location. Doing so could cause her to cancel the appointment. Remember, the purpose of the call is to set the appointment. In this video, I will show you how this gentleman called an escort. I will also share with you some mistakes he made so you can avoid them when calling an escort. Click here to watch the video.   Step 4: Prepare for your date Preparation is slightly different depending on whether your date with the escort is an incall or an outcall. Incall is less work than outcall because in outcall, you are the host. I will cover incall first.   Incall Preparation Fresh breath and a clean body is an absolute must! Brush your teeth, use mouthwash, and take a shower. Having good hygiene will get you maximum mileage with her! The most important thing you should do when preparing yourself for your date is to have great hygiene. Take a shower before you go to your date. Brush your teeth and use mouthwash. Smelling good and having fresh breath is not only considerate, but will also get you the most mileage from your escort, now and in the future. Next, make sure you have good directions and you know where you are going. Leave yourself plenty of time to get to your appointment. You will want to arrive 10-15 minutes early. Outcall Preparation Hygiene is still the most important. I covered it in the incall preparation, and it’s exactly the same here. However, also you are the host, so you’ll want to have a few things for your escort guest. First, tidy up the room, making sure it is clean and not cluttered. This should be no problem if you just checked in or if room service recently cleaned. Leave a fresh towel and toiletries for your escort guest, making sure these toiletries are unused and unopen. Lastly, offer some refreshments. You can go as fancy as you want, but simply having bottled water on ice is more than enough to be a good host.   Step 5: The date   The date is the easiest part. But there are two areas where newbies make mistakes. Never talk about the money. Never ever. Place the “donation” in a blank envelope and place it where she can easily see it. One of these areas is the donation. Place your donation for her in a blank envelope, and set it in an inconspicuous spot. The two best places are either the bathroom counter, or on top of a desk or dresser. Be sure to make it easy for the escort to spot. You do not want to hand the money to her directly! The reason for this is the money is intended as a donation for her time. Handing the money to her could legally interpreted as money in exchange for a sex act. Click here for more information on “is prostitution legal and is escorting legal?”. Now, on getting things started. The escort will know that you are nervous, so usually she will strip an article of clothing first. I suggest using the mirror technique. When she takes an article of clothing off, you take off that same article of clothing off. Soon you’ll find yourself having the time of your life, and next time, you won’t be a newbie any longer.   Conclusion I hope you got some great information from my article. The next step is to learn the most common mistakes most men make when finding, calling, and going on an appointment with an escort. Avoiding these mistakes will go a long way to your personal safety, your success, and your experience with an escort.

You don't need to know my name but I am 24 and am still a virgin. I want to have sex with a women. I considering saving up and purchasing an escort to lose my virginity. I just have general questions on escort services and any information that you may have would be very helpful. Thank you. I don't want a strip dance or anything like that, I want to penetrate (with condom whatever) and the only requirement I have is a relatively clean-looking girl/women. I see a number of escort services listed for my area (NE USA) in my Yellow Pages book. When I call, how do I properly express a desire to "have sex" and not anything else, like a 'hot oil rub'? Is there a specific term I should use when I call that may be "coded" or "known only in the industry"? I really want to have sex so any help would be appreciated. I am a good looking man, but I am shy and don't want to try and find a girlfriend for the night in a bar or something, and I don't have a well paying job for a long term girlfriend at the moment. Again, any help is awesome. Thanks. :) TheLostBoys 04-03-2012, 05:31 You're better off going to a bar & getting a girl. Once you get a girl drinking & shes enjoying your company, you usually will get laid.......... If you wanna go the escort route, make sure you explain the person you call what you're looking for in a woman. Dont say anything on the phone about sex & how much money for certain sexual encounters. If you want step by step on what to do correctly, just google your question about escorts & you should get an answer..........remember, google is your friend. shahab6 04-03-2012, 09:06 you have to ask them, do you offer full services. or how much for full services If they say yes, it means sex is involved. I don't recommend you contact an agency in the Yellow Pages, because they charge a lot more, usually twice as much as a non agency girl. you can find individuals escorts online directories, or even some online classified website. They refer to themselves as individual escorts. You can also ask them how much for one hour? usually one hour means full on sex 30mins means blowjob. Usually what I do is I call them, and I tell them I saw your ad online, how much for your service? they usually reply with oh 30mins is x dollar and one hour is x dollar. if they offer incall, they give me some close location to where they are, for example, they will say once you are on this street, give me a call. Once I reached that street, I call them again, then they give me the complete hotel or rarely there apartment address, unless your a regular, then they will let you go to there place. a lot of them usually live in these hotels. Once I reached the hotel, then they give me the room number. Once you're inside, if there friendly, they will chat a little bit 5-10mins, if they're not friendly, immediately they will tell you to take off all your clothes and sit on the bed, then they will tell you to rub them. I guess the point is, if you're undercover, you won't get completely naked, but I don't know if this is a myth or not. Just like when they say if you ask a undercover if there a cop, they have to say yes, which is a complete myth. Anyway after a few mins of rubbing or nude message, they will tell you to put the donation aside. Once you put the money aside, she completely gets naked, if not already, she will start giving a few mins of blowjob, to get you completely hard if your already not and then she will tell you what position you like, then you have sex with her, until you cum, and then you go home. since you never had sex life. I recommend you do this, for different reasons, one you will realize that sex is overrated, two you will have more confidence with the average girl. A lot of these escort girls, are a lot better looking than the average girl, you will have that feeling you just had sex with a good looking girl, and if you get turned down by the average girl you won't feel as bad. Janja 04-03-2012, 10:14 Thank you so much for that post shahab6. Helpful beyond what I had hoped for. shahab6 04-03-2012, 21:12 Thank you so much for that post shahab6. Helpful beyond what I had hoped for. no problem, keep us updated on your experience. i against i 04-03-2012, 21:34 make sure you wank a lot before you go. or drink a couple beers or something. i'm pretty sure if i was in this situation i would just blow on the first thrust. and i have done that and it's absolutely no fun! also this book http://www.amazon.com/Hot-Sex-How-Tracey-Cox/dp/055338032X is fucking amazing, i read it alot before my first time and was great. have fun! BeachBum4u 06-03-2012, 01:49 make sure you wank a lot before you go. or drink a couple beers or something. i'm pretty sure if i was in this situation i would just blow on the first thrust. and i have done that and it's absolutely no fun! also this book http://www.amazon.com/Hot-Sex-How-Tracey-Cox/dp/055338032X is fucking amazing, i read it alot before my first time and was great. have fun! DITTO! She'll most likely have you so turned on, you'll be done before you even get started with intercourse. For someone in your situation, it's just biologically "the way it is". I don't know what else to tell you but do try your best to enjoy it though. It doesn't get much better than new p*ssy!! Alex000 06-03-2012, 05:59 This is not the way I would have wanted to lose my virginity. I lost it very naturally, unexpectedly. It was fluid and just "right". IMO that is how it should be. Sex is VERY important in human nature. You do not want your first experience to feel artificial or forced or manufactured, I think you should wait until the right woman comes along. Being a virgin is not something to be ashamed of at all. Social anxiety can be solved in a number of ways, and you can transform yourself into a very desirable character with the right attitude and the right demeanor. It may be hard to believe, but nothing is impossible. Waiting will make it that much better. It is the hunt that makes the kill so fun. You want a woman to be with you because she wants to for her pleasure, not for money, not to get by, not because she has to. I have nothing against the act of prostitution itself. IMO it should be legal, but I really advise you not to lose your virginity via this method. xstayfadedx 06-03-2012, 06:38 I thought on bluelight we weren't suppose to give advice on illegal topics or am I wrong on this? Anyways I think you shouldn't do it... Its just not worth it. You should wait until you find someone because what are you going to do when you want to have sex again? (I'm sure you will want to). Are you going to call up the escorts every time? Isn't it actually more nerve racking getting an escort than just a regular chick.... I don't know but think this through. shahab6 06-03-2012, 18:22 This is not the way I would have wanted to lose my virginity. I lost it very naturally, unexpectedly. It was fluid and just "right".

Plus he mentioned he doesn't want to get a gf. Jonb 07-03-2012, 02:20 Remember you aren't paying for sex... You are paying her to leave. Nothing wrong with that IMO. J Alex007 07-03-2012, 02:29 Stay away from escorts. The pimps and their escorts will take every newbie to the cleaners. And since you're new to the game you will not be able to filter out who is legit and who isn't. Alot of chicks offering GFE are anything but GFE. What they say on the phone or in their ad doesn't mean shit. They'll rape u on the options or they'll walk out on u after 10 mins even though u paid for the hour. You'll be sitting on the bed alone all clueless, jerking off for 50 minutes while being 300 bucks poorer. Real, all day erryday, beleeeeve dat. Oh yeah, and if the encounter happens to go well, you might end up pussywhipped and hooked on paying for sex, forever. And you know how that ends, so be careful my brother. billdeserthills 07-03-2012, 03:24 I can't believe all the negativity on here. You should do as you like, as you have no one to please save yourself. Not that I have ever paid for it, but millions of people have and nobody can say they were all wrong. augustaB 07-03-2012, 03:50 Gee, I lost my cherry to a hooker when I was just 17. She was nice really. It was just me that was stupid ;) Lots of escorts advertise in the classifieds. The younger ones charge more. A mature lady may well be more understanding. Please be polite when do your visit and please don't be drunk. Hookers hate having to deal with drunks. Agree your price and what you want before starting. Don't take more money than you can afford with you. Don't be shy and don't hide your body away. A working girl will have seen more men's bodies than you can imagine. As long as it's clean they don't mind too much. Be friendly but don't expect friendship. I had a period in my life that I visited lots of hookers. Some of them were nice, some of them indifferent. Everyone was different, so just be yourself. stardust.hero 07-03-2012, 03:55 you have to ask them, do you offer full services. or how much for full services If they say yes, it means sex is involved.

Amazing advice. The part about gaining confidence is really important. Goodluck Janja <3 axl blaze 07-03-2012, 07:25 I thought on bluelight we weren't suppose to give advice on illegal topics or am I wrong on this? not quite true. this is a harm reduction board, where we realize that people are going to do what they are going to do - we just want to help them reduce the risks think about the logic there - if we didn't give advice for illegal topics, this whole site would be shut down! possessing/doing drugs is illegal, after all :) shahab6 07-03-2012, 19:43 They'll rape u on the options or they'll walk out on u after 10 mins even though u paid for the hour. You'll be sitting on the bed alone all clueless, jerking off for 50 minutes while being 300 bucks poorer. Real, all day erryday, beleeeeve dat. Oh yeah, and if the . has that ever happend to you, where the girl walked out on you after 10mins? Also not doing something in fear of it going bad is no excuse in not doing something. Im sure a lot of us got bad drug product, but that didnt stop us from not ever doing it, we went to someone else. Thats the problem when things are illegal, if it was legal, like someplaces, you don't have to worry about that stuff. When things are illegal, it can create many problems for both parties. When its not regulated, bad things can happen to both side. LuGoJ 07-03-2012, 20:33 Stay away from escorts. The pimps and their escorts will take every newbie to the cleaners.

I would do a lot of reading on hobbyist forums before you even entertain the idea. The last thing you want is to get played. shahab6 07-03-2012, 21:25 Also if you found a good looking friendly nice one, You can call her again. so you don't have to keep looking again for another.. As other say they can scam you. But then again half the fun is looking for new one, and being with a new one. xstayfadedx 08-03-2012, 00:55 not quite true. this is a harm reduction board, where we realize that people are going to do what they are going to do - we just want to help them reduce the risks think about the logic there - if we didn't give advice for illegal topics, this whole site would be shut down! possessing/doing drugs is illegal, after all :) I was high and worded that wrong. I thought we weren't suppose to give advice on how to get a hooker? I don't know I'm wording this wrong still but it doesn't matter. Like how we aren't suppose to say how to sneak drugs into jail or how to rob a store. Get what I'm sayin? billdeserthills 08-03-2012, 05:51 I was high and worded that wrong.

I don't know I'm wording this wrong still but it doesn't matter. Like how we aren't suppose to say how to sneak drugs into jail or how to rob a store. Get what I'm sayin? I get it. In a lot of places paying for a prostitue is illegal. In other places it's completely legal. I don't know where the OP is from so for all I know prostitution could be completely legal in the country where he's from. I don't think it's the best thing to buy sex or even do sex for pay as your first time having sex with someone but everyone's different and while I've never done either some people have done one or the other and it's their choice. Alex007 08-03-2012, 07:05 Truth. I would do a lot of reading on hobbyist forums before you even entertain the idea. The last thing you want is to get played. The fact that you used the word hobbyist shows that you know what you are talking about. OP, forget every single thing that everyone has told u on this thread and focus on what LuGoJ just advised, " I would do a lot of reading on hobbyist forums before even entertaining the idea." On those forums you will discover which agencies are legit and which aren't and which chicks are GFE and which are scams. Alex007 08-03-2012, 07:15 has that ever happend to you, where the girl walked out on you after 10mins? Let's just say someone very very close to me runs a legitimate agency that assures GFE and client satisfaction. Every wealthy hobbyist from NYC, Boston, Vermont, etc comes to my Canadian city to hobby. If you know anything about the game you could easily guess which city that is. Many chicks are infamous for ditching their clients in the first 30 mins. Some will exploit you with " extra options", and since pussy is such a strong drug, they'll leave u with nothing. Some chicks will straight up tell u to go pay the receptionist, and by the time u get back the "receptionist" will disappear and the escort as well. Some will lie and tell their pimp or the driver that u tried to beat them up, and u know exactly what happens after that. Trust me it's a dirty game. DrunkardsDream 08-03-2012, 07:33 Stay away from escorts. The pimps and their escorts will take every newbie to the cleaners.

Oh yeah, and if the encounter happens to go well, you might end up pussywhipped and hooked on paying for sex, forever. And you know how that ends, so be careful my brother. What is GFE? OP-Do you really want to lose your virginity to a hooker? If you do this use condoms but if the prostitute is any good they'll make you use condoms. Don't a lot of hookers use condoms when sucking dick? Do people give oral sex or rim jobs to female prostitutes or would someone actually want to do this? I know among bisexual and gay men that oral sex sometimes just giving or sometimes just getting is a staple and it's sex but many of us will do it to a BF/partner for hours at a time if we can. I'm not into rimming but I have friends who really enjoy it and love to get it or do it to someone. The only guys I've ever known who don't like getting oral sex or giving oral sex are men who are only into either getting or giving anal sex and that's mainly all they do when they have sex. I am OK with giving anal sex to a man but I want him to be a partner and we use condoms. I have dated men who all they wanted to do was anal sex and I found them to be very boring. I agree with XstayfadedX, the first time you have sex it might not be all that special but you're going to want to do it again with whoever it is and it could be that same night or pretty soon after that. I'm a gay man and while I have never paid for sex I have some older gay male friends who have and they're mainly only attracted to younger adult gay men and have trouble finding them in bars or on hook up sites, and some only do it once a year or a few times a year when they travel for business. Others have kinks or fetishes that their partner does not like to do or doesn't understand so they pay someone to do it for them like how some men pay a Dominatrix. Alex007 08-03-2012, 08:18 GFE means Girlfriend Experience. In GFE, the escort offers you services that are typical of a girlfriend; BBBJ (blowjob without a condom) LFK/DFK (light or deep french kissing) DATY(eating her pussy) and penetration with a condom. If the client is not getting these services even though he paid for GFE, he is getting fucked in the ass. Client can also opt for extras on top of the basic GFE services. This would include things like CIM( cumming in her mouth) GREEK(anal sex), etc. All of these will cost extra. However, some chicks might provide these services in the basic GFE package, which is a great offer especially if she is superrrrrrrr hot. And yes, some escorts rim guys and vice-versa.

Escorts are not known for kissing their clients, but today men are paying for high-priced escorts who are willing to kiss them, "date" them, and be their pretend girlfriends. It's called the "girlfriend experience", and escorts are no longer called hookers, prostitutes, whores or hos; they are now called "providers". Customers, previously known as punters, or Johns, or dirty old men now refer to themselves as "hobbyists". Kristin Davis, the Manhattan Madam whose former clients included New York's Governor Eliot Spitzer, says that when men call up and want the GFE, (or the girlfriend experience), they ask for a "a nice girl" which is escort code, since prostitutes don't want to describe over the phone what sexual activity will be exchanged for money. "This usually means that they want kissing and unprotected oral," she says. "It's code for paying for things a girlfriend would do with her boyfriend such as foreplay, non-rushed sex, and cuddling," she notes, a concept interesting to any woman (and believe me there are many) who have had sex for free with no foreplay, two minutes of penetration, and zero cuddling. It's also a trend explored by Steven Soderbergh in his 2009 film The Girlfriend Experience featuring adult film star Sasha Grey, pictured. Advertisement The GFE starts with dinner at a nice restaurant followed by making out on the sofa back at her place - often her own flat, where the sexual menu generally includes - DFK (deep French kissing), BBBJ, (bare-back blow job), DATY (dining at the Y), mish (missionary), doggie, and if she's really a good girlfriend A level (anal sex). There are websites (such as theeroticreview.com) where men with a fun hobby can read restaurant-style restaurant reviews of high-end UK prostitutes. On the Erotic Review website you can see pretty much what you're getting via links to the provider's site and titillating reviews. MORE GIRLS The sexiest girls at Paris Fashion Week S/S '17 GIRLS The sexiest girls at Paris Fashion Week S/S '17 Hottest Women of the Week: Emily Blunt is our leading lady in New York GIRLS Hottest Women of the Week: Emily Blunt is our leading lady in New York Hottest Women of the Week: Rihanna unveils new fashion range in Paris GIRLS Hottest Women of the Week: Rihanna unveils new fashion range in Paris Zara Larsson: Live on British GQ Facebook now GIRLS Zara Larsson: Live on British GQ Facebook now Between £200 and £1,200 buys you a dream girlfriend who is an eight ("totally hot"), a nine ("model material"), or even a ten ("I can't believe it's a service!"). Reading the provider reviews assures that you'll never get a four ("only if you're drunk"), a three ("homely"), a two ("ugly"), or a one ("I was really scared"). Reviews are blow-by-blow and start with a description of how the escort looked at first glance ("She opened the door scantily clad in sexy lingerie and very high, high heels"). Then her body parts are sized up. The Erotic Review website has a check list of breast appearance that includes perky, rock hard, super-nice, droopy and unnatural. Under pussy the choices are natural, partially shaved and shaved. The PSE or porn star experience is increasingly popular, since guys watch so much porn they want to actually have sex with the real thing. Advertisement According to Mckenzies Escorts, which provides escorts throughout the UK that combine the GFE with the PSE, "If you are looking for an unbelievably naughty girlfriend experience with a real porn star, look no further! All of our porn star escorts have insatiable appetites for wild encounters. None of them are ever shocked. They are the naughtiest, dirtiest, filthiest sluts available." According to the Erotic Review, escorts are rated on a one to ten scale for performance. "An escort provider is only eligible to earn up to a seven, the site notes, "unless she is willing to perform one or some of the following during a session: kisses with tongue, bare-back blow job, really bi and anal sex. For each of these services, her potential max score is raided by one point, with ten as an absolute maximum." For those aspiring to try a new "hobby", the newbie board on the Erotic Review answers all questions and suggests how to get started. "How do you pay?" asks one guy. "I don't want my wife to see my credit card statement." "You put the cash into an envelope," answers an experienced hobbyist. "Then you hand it to the girl beforehand. It's called the donation." Er, duh! Veronica Monet, a former escort who wrote a book called Sex Secrets Of Escorts, says that the girlfriend experience is popular because the men requesting it "want an intellectual and emotional connection". On the Erotic Review message boards, escorts also join in the discussion. During one exchange a provider writes, "I always have regulars who fall in love with me. It's really annoying." Advertisement As part of a sex survey conducted by the site, 50 per cent of those who responded said they were married. Another 44 per cent said they "would leave their 'SO' (significant other) for an active provider". "Since I've become an escort," says another woman, "I've never had so many marriage proposals in my life." Originally published in the November 2009 issue of British GQ.

Hopefully I will be able to shed a little light on this sexy subject, including many of the myths and misconceptions you might encounter. But first I'd like to separate fact from fiction between a girlfriend relationship experience with a Thai female and that of a girlfriend sexual experience with a Thai female. The content on this page is dedicated to foreign nationals wishing to share a few fun-filled hours with a pretty Thai female sex worker. That is, whether you wish to visit a go-go bar, a beer bar, a massage parlour or an escort agency. The term Girlfriend Experience, also commonly known as GFE is generally considered to be a kind of personal interaction between yourself and the pretty girl you think might be able to add just that little extra sparkle to your possible boring existence, even if it is only for a short while. I imagine it's kinda like being in heaven if this is what you imagine heaven to be. Sexy Thai Girls An erotic girlfriend experience in Thailand can vary from one person to another and sinfully put, goes way beyond simply having sex. It can mean the difference between things like not having to rush headlong into things and having a lot more quality time. It can also mean more satisfying interaction when it comes to things like french kissing, foreplay, fellatio, and who knows, a heck of a lot more. What I really want to focus on here is to give you some insight into the solutions on what is needed in order to have the maximum of fun and where you need to go in order get that much fun. We will also look at some of the pitfalls and what you need to look out for. It might just be worth your while to fast track your ability to get "street smart" as soon as you possibly can. It can make all the difference between having a really great time and being sorely disappointed.  And there are always going to be some who continually complain when their girlfriend experience in Thailand goes horribly wrong. There are those who find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time. There are those who have had far too much to drink. And there are those who are a little too impolite or there are those who simply look unkempt and carry too much excess baggage. Pattaya Beer Bar Girls The Good, the Bad and the Ugly Heartfelt Complaints and Common Mistakes Heartfelt complaints can be girls who turn a long time into a short time. Girls wanting to push off earlier than expected or leaving first thing in the morning. There are always going to be tons of reasons why your girlfriend experience in Thailand can go in all the wrong directions. There is a simple explanation to this. One common mistake I frequently see being made over and over again in Thailand is that far too many naive and unfamiliar hot blooded males get overly excited or just plain gaga when confronted by so many beautiful females in a place where it's the exact opposite in their own natural environment or ideology. What you need to understand, is that you must on all accounts, stay focused and never ever be in too much of a hurry in your final decision making. If you are, you could easily end up choosing the wrong girl and with that, your dream experience could be long gone. Never ever give up though, as there are plenty more coming your way. Be patient. You know what they say - If you miss one bus, there's another on its way, sooner than you think. Other common mistakes people make that need to be addressed are as follows: Always behave in a respectful and courteous manner. You'll be surprised how many doors you'll be able to open and with good cause too. That Thai girl you've chosen will see this as a sign you have shown good faith and good face. And with that, she'll more than likely take care of you just that little bit extra. Just remember Thai girls also like to be treated well too. As a bonus, tell her that if her cards are stacked in the right places, there's going to be a very nice tip at the end of the performance. Don't be too stingy now. It's all going to go for a good cause. Happy Go-Go Bar Girls in Pattaya Girlfriend Experience in Thailand  Go-Go Bars To begin with, you have to understand that not every day is going to be a good day just like everything else that's destined to happen in your life, so you'll have to appreciate there are no guarantees either. However, if you go out there with your best foot forward, you'll be well on your way through the hurdles I'm going to guide you across. Some are so much better than others. Though there are many ways to enjoy a girlfriend experience in Thailand, some involve more effort than others. In this article I'm only going to cover the ones that require as little effort as possible and where you'll get to encounter a true girlfriend experience in Thailand. These are based on my personal experiences. In my opinion, getting to know the girls in Go-Go Bars can be a harrowing experience, especially for the novice as you never quite know who or what you might end up with. Once you enter a go-go bar - and it doesn't matter where in Thailand you are - you're going to be a target with the possibility of just too many girls clambering for your attention all at once. This has happened to me many times and believe it or not, it could happen to you too. Don't get me wrong, you might love it I'd have to say that go-go bars are not the best places to start looking for your first true girlfriend experience. That is not until you've you've gained of at least some knowledge of how things work in these establishments. The reason for this is that in all the chaos and confusion and coupled with the fact that you may have consumed one too many drinks, the girls appear way too willing to please. And a simple explanation to this, could be because all these girls you've just met in the heat of the moment, are really only interested in relieving you of all your cash and not actually relieving you of what you came here in the first place for. The only thing you are certain to be left with the next day is one heck of a headache minus much of your cash. If I could make a suggestion, you need to go to many go-go bars before identifying possible dangers, if any. Think about this for a moment. As I've said before - You need to stay focused. And judging by the smiling faces and sexy bodies below, I'd say that's a hard act to follow. Bangkok Girl Gucci Bangkok Girl Biya Girlfriend Experience in Thailand Beer Bars and Massage Parlours Next up in trying to find that true girlfriend experience in Thailand are the girls you're bound to come face to face with in the beer bars, of which the town of Pattaya appears to boast the biggest bar scene of this kind. And let me tell you, it's impossible to avoid them. The encounters you'll likely come across in these bars are only slightly better than what is inevitable at go-go bars. The only real difference here is that in a beer bar, your time is never really rushed. You can easily spend the whole day in a beer bar from around 2:00 pm until closing time at midnight or thereafter depending on each establishment.  From my experience, the girls you find in beer bars are not necessary the prettiest you'll come across in town and at times can be a little pushy, especially if you're just passing by on your quest to find a bar you think will best suit your needs, whatever that may be. However, they can be quite friendly.  Also girls in beer bars tend to dress down a lot more whereas girls in go-go bars tend to dress sexier and by far, a lot prettier. Nevertheless, your chances of having a real girlfriend experience in a beer bar are that much better than in a go-go bar. The next best thing to a go-go bar and a beer bar and a true girlfriend experience in Thailand must surely be at a soapy massage parlour of which there are lots around in both the major cities and resort hot spots. You'll even find them at many of the top island destinations too. Some say that you haven't been to Thailand if you haven't had a soapy massage. I have to say there's a lot of truth in that, but don't take my word for it, give it a try yourself. After which drop me a line and tell me just how much you enjoyed your time there. Though there's not much privacy at a massage parlour except of course in your private room or suite, your chances of a true girlfriend experience in Thailand could become that much better. However, don't expect all massage parlours to be equal. Some are better than others and your money could also play a large part in how your encounter develops. I'm not saying that money is everything but it does help. How much can depend on a number of things. I think that finding the right one is the real challenge. Let me know if you need any help.

http://www.sexwork.com/Intimacy/GFE.html|_|Site map Discussion of GFE and Old Dave's Response :( --- In nationalfbsm@yahoogroups.com, Michael <eroshands@y...> wrote: > O.K. Here is what I am saying.

HOWEVER if you say that the definition > was that there is "more" intimacy or its just an > attitude thing or any crap like that, you don't have a > clue what the advertiser provides Michael, Michael.... I believe I was one of the first to coin and use the phrase GFE way back before there was much of a web - there was the alt.sex.prosititution newsgroup which we read by packet readers at the amazing speed of 120 cps (without a k) and it took many minutes to download a single message. Then there was the old Prodigy boards on those very slow dial ups long before Yahoo or many websites. Then websites developed and I first coded libchrist.com having to know raw html code, not the lazy way today...although I would never want to go back to hand coding html. Back in those days we respected providers and would never think of having unhealthy bareback oral or any kind of unhealthy sex. And this was before the HIV scares (which isn't really much risk in heterosexual sexwork, but lots of other nasty STD's are). Many of us seek the GFE experience which means a real relationship for the moment with a sincere women who enjoys the experience, not just mechanical sex. Now you and some young on's come along and expect to totally change the definition for your own selfish, unsafe, ...pardon the expression moronic attitudes. Many of us prefer what you call crap to having a women take the health risks of unsafe sex which she may not even enjoy doing just to please the Michael's that demand their selfish ways. Fortunately I have seen a vast change in attitude about "intimacy crap" over the years. When I use to do Canadian reports on the old Canada Best board, there would be the responses of being sick and tired of all my intimacy crap and real men just fxxk women and none of this intimacy nonsense. But over the years that has drastically changed and zillions of men being more in tune with their more intimate side and find they enjoy it far more than being the big macho sex stud. It's been years since I've had that negative response on the boards I am active on - Mostly Canadian - with my zillions of Canadian reviews since I prefer for sexwork, to be in a country not run by the religious right where consenting adults have the sexual freedoms we do not have in the U.S. Not to mention far lower costs when you don't have the legal risk premium. Girl Friend Experience - Short definition What it means to each person is a little different, but to most guys it means a provider that makes the experience seem unrushed, enjoyable, fun, relaxing and more like a "real date than a quick commercial encounter. In practice, though, it seems to depend on chemistry, personality and mutual expectations, as YMMV ("your mileage may vary") for both the provider and client. A general description might be: a session that facilitates the experience, mutual cuddling/foreplay, mutual kissing, mutual oral sex (covered or uncovered--depending), and involves either the illusion or reality of passion on the part of the provider. Most of all its about being a sincere mutually desired human interaction. It is the opposite of the women being treated like a sex toy and the man an ATM machine. Old Dave in Phoenix who enjoys intimacy more than hot sex. Longer Discussion: Here is my vew of GFE which I realize is not shared by all, that is fine, its just one view: GFE by Dave in Phoenix Many people in reviews public and private say they seek GFE To me, GFE is "Girl Friend Experience" like renting a girl friend for the hour instead of the more cold, detached "hooker" type pro. Obviously many of us seek this GFE, not a pro like many in Nevada etc. Most importantly, a GFE is natural, not mechanical or forced. No matter what kind of play is desired it should feel like 'the real thing'. But GFE is defined differently by different people. For me, GFE involves having an emotional and intellectual connection with a provider like you would with a real girlfriend, not just a body for physical sex. Some define it by what things a provider will do such as kiss or if they will do bareback (I don't recommend). But I've experienced very mechanical kisses and relate it more to that "connection" on a deeper level than only the body, even if only for the moment, is paid for and you may not meet her again. Often I have heard a provider reply to the question "Are you GFE" with "You mean you want me to nag you a lot?" I also relate to what I refer as a "universal love", which many people just don't agree with our cultures definition of "love". GFE and "love" can be for the moment, it doesn't have to result in "falling in love" that many are so afraid of. It is more like standing in love of a unique spirit of a person and seeking to express this Universal love by sensual pleasure giving touch, sensuality and sexuality. But we are taught in our culture "love" has to be exclusive and possessing another. In the GFE I seek, I especially enjoy caring high touch intimacy, stoking, massaging, holding her, caressing her trying to relate to her inner spirit via high tender touch not a body to have sex with. Combine this GFE intimacy and sensual sexuality and I really enjoy the experience. While there are exceptions, I find very few American providers offer this. The attitude in the U.S. is often "oh, I save all emotions for my boyfriend". This contrasts sharply with women I've met from many other cultures, European, Latin America, Asian, that seem so much more open to sharing GFE and the type of intimacy I enjoy. The reasons are quite obvious. Most other cultures don't have the repressive sexual attitudes that we do in the U.S. Often foreign women are much more naturally open, intimate and provide easy GFE which is often totally foreign to most U.S. sexworkers. Their are of course exceptions of wonderful GFE providers in the U.S. and hard business only pro foreign women. But in my "studies" of providers in various parts of the world, as well as for example in Los Angeles and San Francisco, where you have lots of foreign women at hostess and strip clubs etc., my overwhelming experience is this obvious difference in cultures. In response Caitlin a Phoenix sexworker said: "While I have not advertized myself as GFE, that is what many of my clients have experienced. To me it is a question not of what you do, but how you do it. It definitely involves some kind of "connection," as Dave put it. When I'm with a client, I genuinely want both of us to have a good time. I usually manage to find something (or a lot) about their personality that I like, which makes it more fun for me. GFE definitely means no clock watching, filling out the hour if he finishes early, a massage if he wants it, things like that. A GFE may or may not include kissing. I like what CJ said about earning a kiss. If it doesn't happen on the first date, don't despair, it might happen on subsequent dates. If there is no genuine desire in me to give you a kiss, it will be mechanical. I always appreciate a client who lets me kiss him first before he kisses me. It seems to me a GFE is rather indefinable. Everyone has a different idea about it. That emotional connection is an intangible, and there is no guarantee that you and your provider will experience it. And one needn't have a FS provider to achieve that either." Dave says, that was a great response from Caitlin, who I thank for her input (reposted with her permission) More good thoughts: by St. Louis Guy: "GFE is one thing to one person, another thing to another, but I know from experience, that you can share an hour (or most times less) with a very beautiful woman and feel totally ripped off afterwards, mainly due to a "get it over" attitude, which says, "Hurry up, pay me, and I'm outta here!!" Those experiences, widely experienced in Vegas and other markets with certain agencies or individual providers really suck, especially when you pay higher dollar. The best GFE is the girl or woman who treats you in a relaxed, human (not mechanical) manner, and responds. She doesn't have to kiss, but many do, and safe sex is the rule, of course. But it is the willingness to do MORE than "lay" there and let the guy "get off".... It's a GFE like this with a gal who might be attractive, but not a total "knock-out", that sweetly lingers in the memory. The message to providers should be...treat us the most humanly way possible, get into it, and leave an impression. That's the way to do it! " But not everyone wants GFE such as what one man said: "Some guys want/like a GFE but not all us. Snuggling, holding hands, caresses ..... ugh Sorry, I want it hot and nasty. " And more wisdom from retlakk: "Personally, I get the most pleasure out of sex when we both have a good time. I really try to turn the girl on and please her. Stroking, cuddling, kissing is all part of that, and it's surely unnatural to preserve complete emotional detachment while giving this the full attention which it deserves. Maybe it's a question of age. I'm over 50, have had several girlfriends. I don't think I'm going to get lovesick over a sex affair. For a young man, it might be different. Yes, there is some danger of getting hooked, these girls are not called "hookers" for nothing. But treating a girl like some kind of animated rubber doll misses most of the point of making love." So different men seek different type of providers, hot and nasty or more intimacy and that hard to define intangible GFE. by ecto , Mar 03,2001 Thank you Dave for such a thoughtful, excellent post. Without quite realizing it, I've also been seeking a GFE, an intimate, mutually satisfying encounter on a human rather than commercial level. I don't think that it's a contradiction in terms. A paid for experience doesn't have to be money driven. Sex surrogates do the same thing, but are more socially and legally accepted, and have professional degrees. Of course, speaking as an American, I think there's no doubt that the puritanical US culture is among the most repressed in the world, so that sex, which is inherently such a joyful, intimate and wonderful human experience becomes, devoid of joy, mechanical, and emotionally barren. I've stopped going to SPs in the US. My best experiences have been in Canada and Australia in particular, with its legalized brothels, and cult of pleasure throughout the society. Aussies just love a good time, and aren't ashamed about it. Friends have told me that the same is true in Japan, and that the most physically beautiful women are found in the sex trade. I guess they feel that they are more accepted and rewarded for doing such work, a heritage from the days of the concubine.

EDIT Edit this Article Home » Categories » Relationships » Dating » Getting a Date Article Edit Discuss Edit Article How to Be an Escort's Favorite Client Community Q&A Learn the correct conduct when dealing with an escort. What and what not to do if you want to be a great client. Steps 1 Wherever you find your escort, research her. Does she have a website, does she have ads going back at least 6 months, does she have reviews (although some escorts do not like being reviewed)? Google her name and phone number or email before contacting her. Also expect her to want to screen your for her own safety; be respectful and provide whatever info she requires. 2 Be on time, or call if you will be more than 10 minutes late. Unless you are giving notice of a time change well in advance, expect to pay for the time you missed. If your 60 minute date was supposed to start at 7 and you get there at 7:15, STILL LEAVE AT 8. Please respect the escort's time and schedule, and don't linger. Even if the escort genuinely enjoyed the time with you, it is annoying and awkward if you overstay. If you want more time, ask and if she says yes, expect to pay for it at the rate previously discussed. 3 Know what's on menu in advance and do not deviate from it. Escorts use code words like, CIM, greek, GFE, PSE... google these before you call or email. 4 Never ever discuss sexual acts or money in person. For your own safety! If it is a sting, they will try to get you to say what you are there for out loud. When in doubt, kiss the girl or ask her to get more comfortable. If she complies, green light! 5 Money first always! If you must refer to it at any time, call it a gift. Do not hand the money directly to her, set it down where she can see it, or wherever you were told to beforehand, (often by the sink in the bathroom). 6 Be nice, treat her like a lady, and be respectful. She is a real person, you don't need to be intimidated and you certainly shouldn't feel superior either. 7 Don't feel like you need to blow her mind sexually. While noble, and very sweet, she is there for you. Do not hold back at the beginning because you want to last for her, this often ends in not being able to finish at all. Which nobody wants. You can take care of her after if you enjoy that, but no pressure here either. 8 Try to read her cues. She is a real women with real likes and dislikes. Not everyone wants to be talked dirty to, or smash-cuddled post coitus. Some might love it though! 9 She will not be offended if you need to leave right after. Whether you need to get back to work, or just aren't into idle chit-chat and cuddling, do your thing. She will enjoy the extra down-time. If you have a genuine rapport or chemistry, or if you are just enjoying the company and a break from real life, then stay the whole time! She will be happy either way. 10 Tip! Always tip. No one care if it's $20 or $200, tip your escort. Unless she was terrible. Tipping lets the woman know that you liked her and that you appreciate her time and effort. This is especially important if you want to see the escort again. If you went for a twofer, then tip extra well! 11 Ask her if she would like to be reviewed. If yes, keep it simple, and do not fabricate. If you say she did something that she didn't, other clients may expect that same service in the future. 12 Always be clean!!! Very very clean. If you just came from work or whatever, take a quick shower at the location. You don't want to be known as the 'Smegma-Guy'. 13 That's it! Real advice from real escorts. 14 Bring wine or a gift. Escorts love this and you will go right to the front of the line, hopefully. Wine can help to get you both relaxed and comfortable, and is a good social lubricant when you have to make all the magic happen in an hour or two. You can ask in advance what she likes, and don't forget the glasses! Gift certificates are always a safe bet if you want to bring a gift, stores like Amazon, Victoria's Secret, Bath and Body, etc. If you know the escort well, you may want to give her more personalized gifts like lingerie, jewelry, and perfume. ****Super extra bonus points if you buy her drinks/take her to dinner first, (WHILE she is being compensated for her time at her usual rate). If you really enjoy her company and can afford to do this, this is the best way to make her feel special. Remember she is on the clock though, and do not ever ask her to meet for free. That is a line neither of you should cross.

Tips Remember that sexual desire is part of human nature and nothing to be ashamed of. If you are older/have no time for dating/want to be discreet/or are socially awkward, there is no shame in seeing a beautiful girl and having it be a sure thing! It's just practical. A good escort takes care of herself, practices safely, vets clients, checks references, and gets tested frequently. Escorts are not dirty, unethical, slutty, addicted to drugs any other stereotype that people associate with us. They, like any other social group, have a range of personalities, preferences and vices. Escorts are regular people and chances are very high that you know women, (or men!), that are in the sex industry in one form or another. They often keep their professions very private because they can be judged harshly. Respect her personal life. If you give her your number, she will most likely not call you, and it has nothing to do with whether or not she 'really' likes you. She keeps her two worlds separate at all times. Always use protection! If you are looking for something specific, it is out there. Domination, humiliation, every fetish you could imagine. It may not be every escorts cup of tea, but if you look hard enough you will probably find it. Always tip extra if you request a special outfit, roleplay, fetish work, toys, etc. If your escort goes above and beyond, so should you. The dream client would tip well, leave early, finish fast, bring a gift, be a regular guy, be polite and respectful. That is just the real truth. Keep in mind though that that is a client that doesn't really exist and no one expects you to be him. It's more about you anyway, and professional escorts love to feel like they did a great job and left the guy with a smile and a lasting memory! Many genuinely like most of their clients and enjoy the job wholeheartedly. Like any group of client service providers, escorts have favorites, mehs, people they don't care for, and people they will refuse to see ever again. Independent girls can be fun too! Make sure they have great reviews and that they vet clients properly before seeing them, (you may feel uncomfortable giving out identifying information, but it is in everyone's best interest!). Agency vs. Independent: Agencies are great if you want to try a variety of girls. Repeat clients are often given special treatment and more consideration. Once you trust an agency, it takes a lot of the guesswork and fear out of the equation. A good agent can give you recommendations based on who you have enjoyed in the past. When you first meet your escort please take some time to talk to them before moving onto more intimate activities. When you first meet maybe give your escort a hug and kiss and ask them to make themselves more comfortable. Warnings Don't fall in love with your escort. Always remember that even though the relationship is mutually pleasurable, and you enjoy each other's company, it is first and foremost a professional relationship. It is her job to make you feel good, and that can easily be confused with romantic love. Don't be that guy. It makes everyone feel bad. Do not expect an escort to just roll with your fetish. If you have something even slightly out of the ordinary in mind, ASK. Ask before the date if at all possible and if not, then ask upon meeting her. Be safe. If a girl will go bareback with you, you better believe she has done it with every guy before you. And never ever try to sneak it in. It's really disrespectful, and will often get you blacklisted. We know that condoms suck. We wish they didn't. They are a necessary evil though. If you can't finish with a condom on, there are other ways to finish It is not the end of the world and it happens all the time+. I do recommend that you try a female condom and see if that feels better to you. If it seems fishy, leave politely. Don't be paranoid though. Do your homework, be cautious and you will be fine. Do not say, "You should be paying ME for this! Har har." Everyone uses that joke. Good luck and happy birthday!

Around the World means oral stimulation of the man’s anus as well as his genitals; as one might expect, the percentage of working girls who will grant this particular request is fairly slim even in the lower echelons.  Even if one chooses to ignore the considerable hygeine issues, the chance of contracting hepatitis A or other diseases is in my considered opinion far too high to risk. BBBJ stands for “Bareback Blow Job”, in other words fellatio without a condom.  In the days immediately after the discovery of AIDS this was widely considered unsafe, and authorities encouraged people to use condoms even during oral sex.  Almost three decades of research, however, have failed to turn up even one single documented case of HIV transmission via oral sex, and the last figure I saw was 0.04% chance of infection due to blood seepage into an undetected mouth sore.  Since that’s roughly similar to the chance of being struck by lightning while walking in the rain, most call girls and escorts don’t worry about it much any more.  Hepatitis B is transmitted much as HIV is, though probably at a slightly higher chance.  Other venereal diseases (including venereal warts and herpes) can certainly be transmitted via oral sex, but since they have visible signs most of the risk can be avoided via careful visual inspection (as I’ve discussed before), copious salivation (which most men find visually stimulating anyhow) and disallowing ejaculation into one’s mouth.  The latter requires careful monitoring of the client’s progress; I always asked him to warn me but also assumed he would not because unfortunately a lot of men are complete assholes on this particular subject and will not give warning despite the increased risk to the girl. Cowgirl we’ve already discussed; the only reason I’m mentioning it here again is because many of my readers are probably unfamiliar with the terms for its variations, reverse cowgirl (woman on top, facing the man’s feet) and Asian cowgirl (as normal cowgirl but with one’s feet on the bed raising the whole body up and down rather than simply rocking back and forth). Deep Throat means taking a man’s penis all the way into one’s mouth.  With a little practice it isn’t difficult, and since it impresses the hell out of men it’s well worth learning.  The trick is to suppress the gag reflex; I suggest practicing on bananas.  Few men are long enough to actually go down one’s throat, and even those that are can be handled unless they are oddly-shaped (as I’ll discuss tomorrow). Donation is originally an internet term; it simply means “fee”, as in “how much is your donation?” Facial means ejaculation onto a woman’s face.  Men who like to do this really like it, but some girls won’t allow it.  Personally I was never bothered by it; it’s not difficult to keep one’s mouth and eyes shut, and since I was blessed with a clear complexion and lovely natural coloring I never needed to wear makeup in those days anyhow.  I could therefore simply have a warm, damp washcloth handy for initial cleanup and then wash my face completely afterward.  I can see how a girl who needs makeup would be averse to clients doing this, however, since it would necessitate a great deal more effort to restore her looks afterward than it did mine.  It also tends to get in one’s hair, but can be brushed out in the short term and thoroughly removed by shampoo later.  Amateurs who say “I would never let a man do that to me!” or “That’s so demeaning!” need to remember those statements when asking “Why does my husband hire whores when I give him plenty of sex?” Full service simply means intercourse, as opposed to just oral sex or masturbation (the latter being the specialty of Asian massage parlors). GFE means “Girl Friend Experience”; it’s a highly subjective term but generally means that the escort will cuddle, kiss, refrain from obvious clockwatching or otherwise make the experience seem much more natural and less mechanical.  A high percentage of call girls provide either “GFE” or its converse, the “PSE” (some men believe that the two are not mutually exclusive within a single call, but I beg to differ).  Of late, I have noticed a distressing tendency in internet venues to attempt to define a GFE by mechanistic criteria (such as whether the girl allows intrusive tongue kissing); IMHO this completely flies in the face of the very idea of a GFE, which is determined by how the girl makes the client feel rather than by a checklist. Greek means anal sex.  It isn’t commonly offered because one simply can’t trust a client to follow the instructions necessary to keep the experience from being painful, but there are always specialists who cater to customers who want it. Hobbyist is an internet term which means a client who sees escorts as a continuing hobby rather than as an occasional pleasure.  Hobbyists generally frequent internet boards dedicated to their hobby and share information with each other; some of them are excellent clients because they know what’s expected of them, never quibble about money, treat girls well and are scrupulous about keeping appointments.  Unfortunately, the rest of them enjoy the hobby itself more than the girls, and can be nasty and exploitative.  Sometimes the term is used in a broader sense to mean any client, but I think it’s more useful in the strict sense. John is a term used mostly by police, the media and others outside The Life for a customer, as in “John Doe” since they are anonymous.  The first recorded appearance of the term in print is from 1911, but it is unclear whether it originated among streetwalkers or started as an outsiders’ term from the beginning.  Since I have never associated with streetwalkers or worked anywhere but New Orleans I can’t speak for whether any working girls actually use the term, but what I can say is that I never heard one do so, not even once, not even as a joke.  I’ve heard “client”, “customer”, “date”, “patron” and even (once) “trick”, but never “john”.  I myself always preferred “gentleman”, not merely because it’s polite but also evokes Amanda Wingfield’s “gentleman callers” in my mind. MSOG means “Multiple Shots On Goal”, in other words the girl allows the man to have intercourse with her more than once if he can.  It’s an internet term, and I must admit I giggled when it was explained to me.  Many girls won’t allow it, which IMHO is rather stupid on their parts since this exists largely in the realm of male fantasy.  What I mean by that is, though a large percentage of men ask for it (by initials or otherwise), only a tiny percentage can actually accomplish it within the time allotted.  So there’s no harm in agreeing to this because most clients will be too spent after the first time even to attempt it again, and a gentle “but sweetie, if it took you 35 minutes the first time how do you expect to do it a second time in ten?” will take care of most of the rest.  And on those rare occasions where the client is both quick on the trigger and able to perform again, why not let him go twice?  It’s his hour, after all, and he paid good money for it. Pearl Necklace means ejaculation onto a woman’s tits.  This can turn into an unplanned facial if the man ejaculates energetically enough. Popped means the same as “busted”, i.e. arrested. Protection simply means condoms.  A lot of people have their own idiosyncratic terms; one girl I knew used to call them “party balloons” and Doug used to refer to them as “dancing slippers” (as in, “get out your dancing slippers, I’ve got a call for you”). Provider is a neutral internet term for an escort, as in “provider of services”. I don’t much care for this one, as it always reminds me of “The Providers”, those disembodied brains who once abducted Captain Kirk. PSE stands for “Porn Star Experience”.  This is slightly less subjective than its converse “GFE”, and refers to a very energetic escort who is adept at visually impressive stunts like deep throat and accepting of facials and other such porn-movie staples. Russian is holding one’s tits together so a man can rub himself between them; obviously, it’s only possible with rather large tits. Trick is old slang for a session with a client (as in “turn a trick”) or sometimes even a client himself.  It first appeared in print around the same time as “John”, and is still used today among streetwalkers and lower-class escorts in some areas (including New Orleans).  Higher-class girls generally prefer “date” or “call”, and I’ve also heard “job” or “deal”; working girls with musical backgrounds sometimes use “gig”. Troublemakers is the term I preferred for the nasty, sadistic busybodies referred to by others as pigs, liars, busybodies, blue boys, heat, LE and a number of other things…in other words, cops, the single greatest threat to any hooker’s health, safety and livelihood. So, there’s a quick explanation of a very few terms; there are plenty of others, but these are most of the common ones which sprang immediately to mind (though I wouldn’t be surprised if I overlooked a really obvious term or two).  As I said above, these are the ones I know from the internet and New Orleans; to list every one from around the world would probably fill a slim dictionary.

Yes, I know that one; I believe it’s of British origin. on September 7, 2010 at 3:21 pm | Reply ant what about half n half, snoball, and blacktoppingk? on September 7, 2010 at 4:03 pm | Reply Maggie McNeill “Half and half” (oral sex followed by intercourse) is only used by streetwalkers, massage parlor girls and other low-end whores who charge by the act rather than by the time period; I’ve never heard it used by an escort. “Snoball” or “snowball” (receiving a man’s ejaculate in one’s mouth, then kissing him and spitting it into his mouth) is a modern “urban” slang term which I suppose might be used about a really skanky, hostile, low-end whore with no concept of personal safety, but certainly isn’t used in the business except perhaps among gay escorts, with whom I’ve never had much contact. And I don’t know the term “blacktopping”, though I have a guess about it; if you choose to explain it, do try to be clinical! on September 7, 2010 at 4:08 pm | Reply ant Heard it on howard stern, so there’s no way i could describe it clinically😉 on September 7, 2010 at 4:35 pm | Reply Maggie McNeill Radio DJ terms are often not real slang; they’re things the DJ comes up with to get around censorship laws (though now that Stern is on Sirius he needn’t worry about that any longer). For example, my husband used to listen to Tom Leykis’ show on occasion and they habitually used the term “hummer” to mean “blow job”. If you wish you can send me the description in an email and I’ll try to rephrase it in as clinical a fashion as I can manage. on September 7, 2010 at 10:15 pm | Reply Sailor Barsoom Teabagging is something a woman can’t do to a man; dirty sanchez is too disgusting to contemplate; rusty trombone has some similarities to ’round the world; and I’m sure we all know what 69 means (but what about 96?). I’m sure that new terms will spring into being when space tourism gets going and people start joining the 100 Mile High Club. “Baby, do you do the X/Y dodec?” on September 7, 2010 at 11:15 pm | Reply Maggie McNeill With the exception of 69, though, I’ve never heard of a guy specifically requesting any of that stuff from a whore.😦 on September 8, 2010 at 8:36 am | Reply Sailor Barsoom Perhaps that’s just as well. On a totally different note, my cute friend has informed me that “Creole” describes her quite well. She’s Creole and then some. Really exotic and cutesy. It’s too bad she’s so asexual; she’d make a fortune. As you say: it isn’t for everybody. on September 8, 2010 at 8:44 am | Reply Maggie McNeill I’ve known quite a few Creoles, and they are often quite beautiful. Unfortunately, they have largely vanished as an ethic group since most now identify as black. Two of the recent mayors of New Orleans were Creole; both called themselves “white” on their Army enlistment papers but “black” when running for office in a majority-black city, and both married black women. To be sure mixed-race marriages are producing children who would’ve been called Creole in the old days, but they aren’t raised in that subculture. on December 27, 2010 at 5:28 am | Reply Asehpe I’m certainly in favor of making dictionaries, since it’s an important part of my day job. The etymology of these terms (usually metaphors or metonymies) is mostly obvious, but one of them stands out: the ‘Russian’. What gives? ‘Greek’ for anal sex is more or less obvious (via Ancient Greek’s surprisingly high level of acceptance of homosexuals, who suggest sodomy to a Westerner’s mind); but ‘Russian’? (I knew that practice from porn as ‘tit-fucking’; is Russian an euphemism? Does it imply Russian women have large breasts? My wife is Russian, and she doesn’t have large breasts…) on December 27, 2010 at 8:31 am | Reply Maggie McNeill I suspect it does derive from the stereotype of big-titted Russian women. I heard the term for the first time less than ten years ago; when I was in my teens the guy I knew used to refer to it as a “Dutch oven”. on January 1, 2011 at 1:10 am | Reply Jack Parsons The “Venture Brothers” cartoon includes this dialogue: “Prostitute: Okay big fella, you first. I charge you ten bucks for the Gilded Lily, twenty for the Roman Holiday, fifty for The Old Walrus ‘n’ Carpenter,and for seventy-five you can Sleigh Ride Down Kilimanjaro.” These terms were made up to mollify the network. Two previous batches of bogus terms were rejected. And something allegedly genuine: Oh, the French girls with their strings of pearls Think it’s such a burning shame That the local boys with their country joys Never make them daisy chains. They’re swapping disappointing incidents While at the dock another ship pulls in And suddenly the door breaks down (Hourah!) It’s the Seven Deadly Finns! Oh soldiers and sailors Have all been there before: Gigolos and governments Have tumbled through that door. Because they need those French girls With all their kiss-curls And powder in their guns And the Seven Finns with the deadly grins Tend to measure beauty in tons! The first is a freak with a masochistic streak And the second is a kitten up a tree The third is a flirt with an awful print skirt And the fourth is pretending to be me The fifth wears a mac and never turns his back And the sixth never shows his eyes But the Seventh Deadly Finn is so tall and slim, He shouldanever been with those guys. Although variety is the spice of life, A steady rhythm is the source Simplicity is the crucial thing Systemically of course (work it on out like Norbert Weiner) So when those French Girls say to you “Would you like your ashes raked?” You’ll have to take their word for it: It’s the only thing to take… (Yodelling chorus) —————————- http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/7deadly.html (Norbert Wiener was an MIT professor.

The “pain” she gave brought much delight With relentless, stinging blows And then, of course There were her “pets” These meek, they liked to play They’d lick up all she served to them Like liver on a tray Oscar liked his nipples clamped And Fred got off on pies And Larry loved his asshole rammed With cocks of every size And April, she would cum for days If her clit was roughly tweaked And Peter lapped up Samantha’s pee When down her leg it leaked Best of all there were the twins A wild, perverted pair Who loved to singe their private parts While other people stared To lick on toes, or suck a cock Seemed dry to her as toast But stick a jar up some chick’s twat? Who could want a better host? The raunchier, the saucier The more depraved the act Would only fuel her fire for more Joy they would transact. As legend goes, Samantha kept A few lovers for herself For she loved them each Like precious gems Placed high atop a shelf “I’ll shine you up.” She purrs to one “And you – I’ll hose you down.” And “Hands against the wall, my pet – Don’t dare to make a sound!” Lustfully, they all complied To each cruel command she gave They lapped between her thighs when asked – And never misbehaved. “Good pets,” she’d coo, and stroke their heads, “It’s time I take my leave” They’d moan and groan, But knew all too well The rewards they’d soon receive. With shackles on and collars latched She locked them all up tight Leaving them alone in fear As day turned into night. Time crept by and her precious few Were restless, scared and hot But, just then – the door squeaked ajar- And Samantha showed them what she’d bought. “Hello, my pets, did you miss me?” Her voice soothed their throbbing aches “I brought you each a brand new toy, Let’s see the mess we make!” And so it went As it often does She got the best of each She rode them hard, she rode them long For she had so much to teach! And so ends this tale At least for now Of Samantha’s lusty lair So now you know And I’d lay odds – That you wish That you lived there! ‡ Comments RSS Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

BCD:  Behind Closed Doors.  This refers to the portion of a date which is spent in the bedroom, i.e. the sexual portion of a session.  It is thus used as a collective reference to sex acts (“BCD activities”) or by girls referring to special “meet over coffee” type deals (“no BCD time”). BFE:  Boy Friend Experience.  It is obviously built on the pattern of “Girl Friend Experience”, which I defined in my previous column; a client might be described as a “BFE” if he’s very nice and easy to deal with, avoids being pushy or demanding, doesn’t haggle and tries to make the date pleasant for the escort by booking multiple hours, taking her to dinner and/or giving her a gift, carrying on an interesting conversation, etc. CIM:  Cum In Mouth.  The use of “cum” to mean “semen” is an American vulgarism dating to the 1920s, and the extension of the vulgar spelling to the verb “come” (which has been colloquially used to mean “have an orgasm” since at least the late Middle Ages, just as the equivalent verb is used in other European languages) is more recent still, dating to perhaps the 1960s.  I don’t think I need to tell any female reader how much ejaculating into a woman’s mouth excites most men, but in the post-HIV world very few whores would allow this.  Unfortunately, as I discussed in my column of February 28th, …in the last decade as escort review sites became steadily more common, many escorts wanted something which would set them apart from the competition.  But the trend really took off just over two years ago when the economy went belly-up; a lot of part-timers lost their regular jobs and therefore needed to bring in more money from hooking, and a lot of amateurs who had never before directly asked for cash flooded into Craigslist and Backpage.  The amateurs had no sense of appropriate professional conduct and the part-timers were desperate to make up the difference from their lost jobs, and so they started to offer things which, while not extremely dangerous like unprotected intercourse, were nonetheless more personal and “edgy” than what had been the norm even as recently as 2007.  And once that happened even many full-time professional escorts were forced to change their policies in order to remain competitive. Though most escorts who allow this still spit or dribble afterward, there are some who offer “BBBJTCNQNS”, which means “bare back blow job to completion, no quittin’, no spittin’”, which I personally consider most unwise. DFK:  Deep French Kissing.  Yes, we didn’t used to allow kissing, either; see the entry for CIM above. DNS:  Do Not See.  Most often used in the formulation “DNS List”, a personal list of men an escort refuses to see because of personal experience, warnings from other girls or statements the listee has made on review boards:  “Any man with an attitude like that goes straight onto my DNS list.” FBSM:  Full-Body Sensual Massage, a combination of therapeutic massage with sensual touching.  See also levels of massage. FIV:  Fingers In Vagina, an activity which I’m far from alone in disliking intensely, though some girls do allow it. LEO:  Law Enforcement Officer, i.e. a vice pig.  Sometimes “Uncle Leo”. Levels (of massage):  A Level 1 (L1) massage is massage with a “happy ending” (i.e. hand job).  Level 2 (L2) massage includes a blow job, and Level 3 (L3) is full service. Lurker:  A “hobbyist” who reads escort boards, but does not generally post on them.  Most of these are the good sort of hobbyists, unlike the bad ones who use their experience and that of others to learn how to cheat, manipulate and intimidate inexperienced escorts. Manmades:  Augmented tits, often abbreviated MMs:  “Maggie has a spectacular set of manmades”. NBA:  No Blacks Allowed.  Escorts with NBA policies will not see black clients for reasons I already discussed at length in my column for September 18th of last year. NCNS:  No Call, No Show.  A client who neither showed for his appointment nor called to cancel; a deadbeat. Nuru massage:  This is not “massage” in the normal sense, but rather consists of the masseuse erotically sliding her naked body up and down against that of her client with the assistance of nuru gel, an odorless, tasteless, colorless and extremely slippery gel made from nori seaweed.  The gel does not dry up and so must be washed off with soap and water; nuru massage thus always ends with a bath or shower.  Nuru massage originated in Japanese bathhouses, or “soaplands”. Outing:  Publicizing the real name of a client or escort, usually to that person’s family; it is considered one of the most reprehensible actions of which someone is capable and will usually result in the total ostracism of the offender. Roses:  A rather silly slang term for “dollars” used in the advertising of inexperienced low-end escorts:  “I expect a donation of 150 roses”. Spinner:  A very thin, petite escort, so called because of the joke that a man can “pick her up and spin her around” while she’s doing cowgirl. Time waster:  A man who has no real intention of paying for an appointment.  Some of them are lonely and just looking for conversation, and others might like to see a girl but are too nervous or frightened to follow through, but most are just cheapskates trying to get free wanking material. TOFTT:  Take One For The Team.  This refers to a hobbyist taking the risk of seeing an unreviewed girl in order to report back to his friends about her. YMMV:  Your Mileage May Vary.  This phrase, borrowed from American automobile advertising, refers to an escort whose performance varies considerably from client to client depending on how she reacts to each individual.

Sometimes “Uncle Leo”. Uncle Leo – this reminds me of Seinfeld’s Uncle Leo. I wonder if the term is a reference to that character? Lurker: A “hobbyist” who reads escort boards, but does not generally post on them. These are the good sort of hobbyists… Why are Lurkers more likely to be the good sort of hobbyist than the ones who post on escort boards? on September 7, 2011 at 3:51 pm | Reply Maggie McNeill Independent escorts who post frequently on escort boards could probably explain it better, but the basic issue is that many (though by no means all) of the guys who post frequently on escort boards are prone to looking for “deals”, haggling, sharing ways to scam escorts with each other, trying to bully inexperienced girls into giving them freebies or cut rates in exchange for good reviews, threatening them with bad reviews, or generally playing pimp. Lurkers are the guys who are busy with real life and/or turned off by the locker-room behavior of many of the more board-active hobbyists, and thus only use the boards for information. on September 7, 2011 at 5:55 pm | Reply krulac “Lurker” here … and I agree with you 100 percent. I don’t even think that the escort reviews can be relied upon in most cases. I tend to think that a guy who’s an asshole on the internet is going to be an asshole with a girl – and so that may negatively impact his experience with that girl. I’ve noticed, a few “hobbyists” that are very pleasant natured and very civil to others on those escort forums tend to have a high number of glowing reviews and speak very favorably of girls personally. On those occasions where they have bad experiences – they tend to blow it off by saying the girl is probably very good under most circumstances, but their experience wasn’t thrilling this one time. Even in a bad experience – they’ll find a way to compliment the girl on her looks, or her personality – or some other positive trait she possessed. NBA’s – many escorts in Europe have that policy too – some go farther with an exclusion against Arabs also. on September 7, 2011 at 6:57 pm | Reply Sailor Barsoom Kama of Kingston had a “No Republicans” policy. If you voted for Bush, she didn’t want you. Had to do with foreign policy, India in particular. I have no idea how she feels about Obama, I don’t know much about him and India, and because her website is gone. She may have another, idk. on September 7, 2011 at 7:00 pm | Reply Maggie McNeill If she was adamant about that, I’m not at all surprised she’s out of business. on September 8, 2011 at 12:18 am | Reply Sailor Barsoom I have to wonder how you enforce such a thing. You don’t get tattooed with R, D, I, or whatever when you vote. Which means she wasn’t having sex with honest Republicans. Ones who lie could still get some. She was also picky about shaving. I was able to find an interview with her, but I think it’s from a few years back. on September 8, 2011 at 9:26 am | Reply Maggie McNeill Exactly. And it would be a ridiculous basis on which to exclude customers even if one could tell; if I had avoided every client whom I thought to be stupid, misguided or guilty of poor judgment I would’ve been a destitute prostitute. on September 7, 2011 at 11:23 pm | Reply Beste Sure some punters do exactly as you describe. But the bullshit/scams goes the other way as well. eg fake positive reviews, false advertising etc on September 8, 2011 at 12:11 am | Reply Maggie McNeill Oh, dear, I would have hoped you had noticed by now that I’m always fair; my column on bad girls was over a year ago now, last August 24th. on September 7, 2011 at 1:51 pm | Reply Sailor Barsoom Uncle Leo is that bad uncle you don’t want your parents to let babysit you. Unless he works in the space program, of course. Uncle Low Earth Orbit is a good guy. on September 8, 2011 at 9:27 am | Reply Maggie McNeill Maybe, but he’s such a drag. on September 8, 2011 at 12:31 pm | Reply Sailor Barsoom {groan}😉 on September 7, 2011 at 5:40 pm | Reply c99 In canada we have a few more that are used in ads. MSOG = multiple shots on goal. Which means you can go as many times as you can in the time period. Very standard here for 1 hr appointments not 30 mins or 15 mins which some offer incall. LFK is light french kissing. on September 7, 2011 at 5:46 pm | Reply Maggie McNeill MSOG and a number of other terms were covered in the previous column. And I’m not saying CIM is “new”, what I’m saying is that most high-end escorts in the United States used to avoid it in the ’80s and ’90s but have recently begun to offer it again. on September 7, 2011 at 6:22 pm | Reply krulac But, in reality – is “CIM” any more dangerous than “BBBJ”? Men always dribble a bit before they shoot. on September 7, 2011 at 6:59 pm | Reply Maggie McNeill It all depends on what the girl’s doing while performing. Speaking only for myself, I absolutely never let anything go any farther than my mouth. on September 8, 2011 at 11:42 pm | Reply JJ Lol is your husband fine with that? on September 9, 2011 at 12:05 am | Reply Maggie McNeill That was past tense, love, and I was speaking of professional interactions rather than personal ones. You may rest assured that my husband has no complaints.😉 on September 9, 2011 at 5:24 am | Reply JJ Lol your husband is a lucky man. Wish I got a chance to see. U b4 u retired😦 on September 9, 2011 at 8:39 am | Reply Maggie McNeill Thank you, JJ!🙂 on September 7, 2011 at 5:42 pm | Reply c99 I dont think CIM is new. In NYC it was very standard for years. on September 8, 2011 at 12:24 am | Reply n/a How many confirmed cases of HIV derive from heterosexual unprotected oral sex? For either party to the act. on September 8, 2011 at 9:29 am | Reply Maggie McNeill None. But there are serious diseases other than HIV. on September 8, 2011 at 12:37 am | Reply Ornithorhynchus So what percentage of hookers do kissing nowadays (if you even know)? I can still remember the first time I heard (from Phil Donohue) that most hookers refused to kiss. I was utterly shocked, and to this day I still find it hard to believe that one could get many customers with such a policy. I would think that kissing would be one of the most important parts of the experience. Maybe I’m a little weird, though. on September 8, 2011 at 9:36 am | Reply Maggie McNeill All that advertise as GFE, which is certainly over half. And you’re totally wrong about the avoidance of kissing being a big problem; there’s a vast difference between announcing “I don’t kiss” and simply avoiding it. I kissed only clients I really liked, and even then I’m not really much of a kisser, yet I was the most popular escort in New Orleans for years. A friend of mine who is an internet independent tells me she largely avoids kissing, yet has plenty of regulars and “DFK” appears in all her reviews. on September 8, 2011 at 8:18 am | Reply bdevereaux On posters versus lurkers: Some posters tend to be chest beating, cock swinging, narcissists wanting to show off to the other guys. What many don’t realize is we read the posts and will “DNS” a guy based off of what they say on the boards (for the reason stated above by krulac). To add a few more terms if I may: TGTBT – Too good to be true. If you see an ad (usually on sites like backpage) of some hot looking young thing that could be a supermodel in Brazil, it’s usually TGTBT and it’s either a sting or a bait and switch. GPS – Golden Pussy Syndrome. Usually complained about by guys who really want to see her but consider her overpriced for their budget. Therefore they accuse her of GPS, saying that she has priced herself too expensive. SDS – (this is a term I made up) Special Dick Syndrome. A guy that thinks he is so great he deserves a discount or that any rules you may have don’t apply to him. on September 8, 2011 at 9:40 am | Reply Maggie McNeill LOL, in New Orleans our term for what you call “GPS” was “platinum pussy syndrome”; I mentioned it in my column of last August 24th. As for the last one there, I used to take pleasure in popping the balloons of (usually young) pompous guys who said stupid things like “I’m young and good-looking, do I get a discount?” by responding with something like, “Oh, you’re young? We charge more for guys under 30 because they’re much more difficult to deal with.” We didn’t really, but I enjoyed hearing them backpedal. on September 10, 2011 at 8:00 am | Reply FlectiNonFrangi Lurker: A “hobbyist” who reads escort boards, but does not generally post on them. These are the good sort of hobbyists… The forums are my Facebook. I don’t want to see pictures of or hear stories of peoples grandchildren. We have a lot of good natured kidding on ECCIE. To think that I am thought of in a negative light because I enjoy posting is really not fair. on September 10, 2011 at 8:48 am | Reply Maggie McNeill I certainly didn’t mean to imply that all the clients who post are bad ones; in fact you might look at my original definition of “hobbyist” from one year ago today, which points out that many hobbyists are among the best of clients! I merely meant that a certain group of those who post frequently are dedicated to bad behavior, and that the lurkers are usually outside of that. It is true, however, that I’ve heard many escorts make blanket negative statements about hobbyists, so perhaps those like yourself who are concerned about being included in that should make an effort to rein in those who engage in the odious behaviors. on August 2, 2013 at 4:00 pm | Reply MadisonElegant i wonder why kissing is so important to men… hell they can’t even do it right… i do not mind but some guys kiss like it is their first time in the back seat of the car,,, way too aggressive can’t control their tongue and then half of them want to stick it in your throat… get a grip on August 2, 2013 at 11:57 pm | Reply Sailor Barsoom A lot of women complain, outside of their hearing, that the men in their lives are bad at this, that, or the other thing. Inside of his hearing they tell their men that they are sexual supermen. So why do you THINK men don’t improve their technique? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it, and we’ve all been told by the one person who should know that it ain’t broke. on February 3, 2015 at 10:40 pm | Reply NightMoves I took up the new hobby about 6 months ago. I am in my 60’s and my wife closed up shop about ten years ago. Prior to that, I was monogamous. Three ladies into my experience, I am delighted and feel so much better about myself. I always make sure I am welcomed back, through a respectful demeanor and gifts. I am lucky to have met them! Also, your deciphering the various acronyms is VERY helpful! on August 28, 2015 at 8:13 pm | Reply dave ROSES, this used to mean $50, because a $50 bill is red. This was standard pre-internet language in classified ads in papers, you could not mention money in any way, so rates were always quoted as a number of roses. This recent use resurgence of roses to mean dollars is very silly. on March 11, 2016 at 6:05 pm | Reply Sarg@Arms Only in Canada, Dave! Only in Canada!

For starters, where in the hell does one find an escort?  Believe it or not, there are a few sources that you can turn to.  Prior to the internet, you either had to know someone OR you could look in the Yellow Pages.  Yes, if you still get phone books, there WILL be listings for some agencies in there if there are any in your area.  I’ve never gone that route, mostly because I’ve heard that they are much more hit-or-miss from the perspective of getting a “good girl” (yes, that is very rude). The 2nd option, and the one that I would venture to say is the most common way that guys and girls play in the hobby, is to go on Craigslist (prior to it closing the adult section down) or Backpage.  For those of you who don’t know, Backpage is essentially Craigslist, just less well known.  It still has dedicated pages for each city, and it certainly has all of the non-sex stuff that Craigslist does (though again, less known).  But, it does have an adult section. If you were to go through Backpage (BP for short), you are best served going to the “Escorts” or “Body Rubs” sections under ADULT.  You can find some other sex stuff in other areas, but for the most part, if you call a number off a page from those two sections, you are likely going to find what you are looking for. Now, there are a couple of drawbacks to using BP.  First of all, you have no way of knowing if the woman is real or not.  She could be an undercover cop, and you could be walking into a bust.  Secondly, you have no idea how good this chick is, even if she IS who she says she is in (which is a crapshoot with BP girls).  Something you may not know as a new hobbyist is that most BP girls are pretty boring lays and they have limited menus (ie. things you can or cannot do with them sexually), and even though they ARE cheaper than the next method (and often you can get them to give you discounted half hour and “quickie” rates, which is rare to find for the next group as well), they often are really only desireable if you literally just want to fuck a warm body. To schedule with these girls, you usually just call or text their listed number, schedule a time, and then show up.  They are usually good for last minute appointments as well, since the bulk of their business are one-time hits off of BP. The final group of girls you can schedule with, and the ones that are most reliable and valuable, are the “review board girls”.  In the hobby, it is VERY important that you be selective with who you see.  That allows you to be discreet, have a good session, and get the most value for your dollar.  Well, prior to the internet, it was pretty much impossible to know which girls were good or not without knowing someone who had seen them.  Then the internet came along, and you have review boards. Escort review boards are exactly what they sound like:  they are a forum system designed to act as a central database for hobbyists and johns to review the details of their sessions with the escorts they’ve seen, to provide information to other hobbyists so that they can make an informed decision about whether or not to schedule a session with an escort.  The more well-reviewed the escort is, the higher the likelihood of getting good value out of the session.  The more poorly-reviewed, the less the likelihood (and also the less likely she will be reviewed at all after 2 or 3 poor reviews).  Little-reviewed girls are often what are called “TOFTT girls”, standing for Take One For The Team, since they are unknowns and the session experience being unpredictable. Obviously, any escorts that are conscious of their image pay close attention to these reviews.  Most sites won’t let the full details of a review be shared with the provider (often shared in a private section called “The Rest of the Story” for established/paying reviewers).  There are often sections of each ERB where escorts can advertise, posting an updated pictures, updates rates/services, or just to bring themselves to the forefront of any horny guy’s search for his next lay. I won’t post any links, but if you are interested, I may chat with you privately about these review boards.  Look me up on Twitter (http://twitter.com/theescortlover) if you want. Often, with providers that post ads on escort review boards, I scroll through all of the ads, flag ones that I find interesting (I usually jot down their information – handle, ad menu/pricing listings, etc.), and then research them to see if they are legitimate options.  I often am left with a list of several potential ladies to see, and I keep that “list” running until its exhausted (haven’t exhausted it in the 2 years I’ve been doing this, FYI, because I keep adding to it constantly by sheer circumstance). When I’ve decided on which escort I’d like to see, I usually contact them via the method they ask to be contacted by (e-mail, private message on that board, call, text, or screening through a 3rd party screening website – which I will discuss more in future posts or questions you can ask me later) to request an appointment.  I prefer texting or e-mail, since I can do that no matter where I am very easily.  Once I am screened (I can go through the “screening process” in later posts, like mentioned above), we usually set a date, and I call 24 hours in advance to confirm the date. It’s important to note here that, if a provider confirms they will see you at this 24 hour point, it is a HUGE no-no for them, reputation wise, to cancel your session after that for any reason other than an emergency (often unverifiable, so it’s hobbyist discretion whether to forgive and forget).  Some hobbyists have tight windows (heh) under which they can hobby, due to family/wife excuses, work scheduling, etc., so good providers always err on the side of caution at the risk of taking a reputational hit on these sites. Now, once you get to this point, the experience is ESSENTIALLY the same regardless of whether it is a BP girl or an ERB girl (I will notate any differences). About an hour or two prior to the session, you either call or text the girl, and she then gives you directions to her incall (the place where she is “working”).  This place is often NOT her home, even if she lives in the area.  If you are seeing a BP girl, you will 90% of the time be going to a hotel (a good majority of these girls are from out of town – traveling 2-3 hours so they aren’t working where people know them), with the other 10% being their actual home (since they are usually not responsible/careful enough to know better if they live locally).  If you see a ERB girl, she will often have an apartment (often shared with at least one other provider – I’ve heard of up to 6 before) dedicated to her “business” if she is local, or it will be at a NICER hotel if she is from out of town.  A small grouping (ie. the actual single girls that don’t expect much company) will use their actual home, as one 23-year old did for me last Saturday when I walked to her downtown high rise apartment. You will usually have a two- or three-call system:  You call an hour before OR right when you are ready to leave, and she will tell you the general area to travel to (“call me when you get to the airport” “go up ::highway:: and call me when you exit ::exit name::”, etc.) and to call her when you get there.  I like to keep in pretty good touch with girls prior to sessions, so I’m usually texting with them up to 3 hours prior just to avoid any communication breakdown.  Then, once you are at the area, she will give you detailed directions to her apartment/house/hotel, and then give you the specific number/directions to her door once you are there (if necessary). For me, the most nerve-wrecking part of every experience is the minute from when I park in the parking lot/driveway to when I walk up and knock on the door.  This is often the time I have a mini-panic attack and have to force myself to go through with the session (especially if the path is crowded ie. people are around) anyway. Knock, knock, knock.  The door opens, and there she is.  The first impression I get when that door opens often will guide the session, and it would take a big swing either positive or negative to affect it after that.  Usually an awkward pleasantry and hug is exchanged, followed by some menial chit chat. Etiquette says that you are supposed to place the “donation” (it’s illegal to pay for sex) in an unmarked envelope on a plainly visible surface, and not to mention it.  This way, you are not going to get caught by an undercover provider in the act of soliciting sex (though obviously it will look bad just being there, but legally I’m pretty sure you are ok) from a prostitute, and the provider likewise doesn’t trap herself either.  Most providers will not raise a fit if you don’t have an envelope.🙂 After that is done, I usually ask to use the restroom, where I wash my hands, among other preparatory actions. At this point, it really is a matter of who acts first.  Since I have a really hard time initiating sex with someone personally (childhood issues), even if they ARE a hooker, I often will just chat with them and sit on the bed (BP) or couch (ERB usually) until they make the first move.  Sometimes (and this happens almost all of the time when you are paying for a session that is less than an hour – half-hour or quickie), the provider simply starts getting naked, and this is usually your clue to also get naked, and you both jump on the bed. From there, you basically have sex (or whatever you paid for – you can pay for blowjobs only, or massages, etc.).  The only quirks depend basically on their menu offerings.  If it is a BP girl, you will likely be jerked off until hard, then she will put a condom on you, blow you until you are ready to fuck, and then lube herself up (honestly, watching a girl lube up is NOT hot…).  Almost all BP girls are CBJ (covered blowjob – BJ with a condom). Ok, let me go ahead and give you a VERY BASIC menu rundown: Kissing – BP girls usually don’t allow it.  For others, it varies between LFK (basically closed mouth kissing) and DFK (full on makeout), or none at all. Oral (her): DATY or FIV will often be listed if done (during review) or available (in ad).  DATY is Dining At The Y (eating out), and FIV is Fingers In Vagina (fingers in vagina).  There’s usually no difference between BP and ERB girls on this – totally woman dependent. Oral (you):  HJ, CBJ, or BBBJ (BBBJTCIM, BBBJTCIMNQNS) are your options, if allowed.  Hand Job is pretty obvious, and don’t think I’ve never seen it offered (it’s often not listed because it’s so necessary).  CBJ was mentioned above, and this is a popular menu offering for BP girls.  I would say that there is a strong correlation between CBJ being the only thing a provider will do and the amount of GFE (girlfriend experience) you will get – basically meaning you are often only expecting a fuck buddy or purely “get off” type of session. BBBJ, or bareback blowjob, is almost a prerequisite for any ERB girl.  Most BP girls charge $200 or less per hour, and they often are CBJ with no GFE.  For an ERB girl, you are often paying at least $180-300 per hour, and you can almost always expect BBBJ with GFE.  ERB girls that do not offer both of these services usually end up being inactive on the boards, and revert back to BP. Note:  The prices I list are for MY AREA, which is considered on the higher side for my state.  You would have to research your specific area to find out the comparable average rates) Now, where ERB girls vary is on the issue of CIM (cum in mouth), CIMNQNS (cum in mouth, no quit, no spit – swallowing to be short), or none.  It’s very rare to see a girl charging higher than $200/hr that will not at LEAST do CIM, though it’s pretty much non-existant that a provider willing to take cum in her mouth will not just go ahead and swallow.  I know of two girls in my area off the top of my head that charge $300/hr (on the high side) and do NOT do CIM, and both of them are probably in the top 5 looks-wise for this area, and also two of the youngest (<25 years old). Sex: Honestly, you know all the acronyms for this (what is CG? what is RCG? what is K9? You got it).  I don’t know of any providers that have any vaginal sex positions that are off limits.  I’d be interested to know if there are any.  The only two things that I know will vary from provider to provider is anal sex and fetishes (hair pulling, slapping, bondage, toys, etc.).   For fetishes, you really just need to check with the provider.  I don’t think any that WOULD do a fetish would charge extra for it, but that’s not my scene.  For anal, BP girls usually use their booty holes as a convenient opportunity to get an extra $50 or so from you (most guys into anal gladly pay), and I think it is free, though provider dependent, for anyone else.  Since I’m not into anal personally, I can’t really speak on it. FINISH:  CIM, COF, COB, CIV, MSOG – CIM already mentioned.  As far as the other ways to finish, they imply that you would be uncovered when cumming (otherwise you just cum in the condom) – cum on face, cum on body (often you need to clear the area of the body, though), and cum in vagina.  I don’t know of any providers that offer the option to let you cum inside their vagina uncovered.  In fact, if there are any, they probably would not advertise it for fear of being identified as someone who is not safe. MSOG is multiple shots on goal, or cumming more than once per session.  For most sessions that last less than an hour, you almost never seen MSOG offered due to the length of time it takes to get one pop (one time to cum), much less two or more.  I have, though, seen MSOG offered for 30-minute “french” (blowjob only) sessions.  BP girls often do not offer MSOG at all, and use the opportunity of multiples to upsell you.  ERB girls typically will use the line “you pay for my time”, and will allow MSOG, especially to regulars.  Since I admittedly cannot fuck for an hour (or even 30 minutes) without cumming, MSOG is often a very important menu offering that has to be offered (I have a funny story about this I hope to post eventually). Afterwards, the girl usually will take the condom off for you if necessary and give you a wipe or warm towel to clean up with, and then it is almost universally polite conversation while you get dressed (some girls stay naked, some put on just underwear, it varies) and ready to leave.  Sometimes, almost exclusively for ERB girls, a shower is offered so that you can clean up in case you need to return to family/work. Upon leaving, you exchange hugs and a promise to visit again soon, and then you leave. So, that’s pretty much all there is to it.  That’s the entire process from idea, to discovery, to scheduling, to session.  If you are an ERB member, you may ask them if it is ok to review them (you get credits for reviewing that is used to give you free private access – some providers do not want public reviews).  If you are a third-party screening site member, you may ask for an “okay” (to be explained later, if necessary).

She was fun even before stator naked. She allowed me to cum inside her in exchange for the additional money to buy a morning after pill. I was the only guy she had allowed to do that in 4 years of work, or so she said. She bought the pill, and that was cool. Well, this became a regular occurrence. Except for the pill part. She just started pocketing the cash. It was a couple of months later, when she sent me the pics of her swollen belly. She said it was cool, and that it was her responsibility. Her boyfriend knew the risks, so he was going to raise him. Call me a freak, but having a fine little escort let me knock her up…what a fucking turn on. Good looking kid, but she doesn’t want me around, because her boyfriend will freak out. I’m one and done on escort bareback though. Luck runs out.

Escorts – A Historical Look The escorting profession has been around since the dawn of civilization and it is widely considered to be the oldest profession known to (wo)man. However, what is considered escorting these days is much different from what it was originally, and today's escorts have taken on a completely new role; much different from the role they played in ancient times. Escorts in Ancient Time History books are littered with references to escorts and courtesans. The first known evidence of escorting can be found in ancient Mesopotamia, in the Middle East. The ancient peoples living there had many shrines and temples and referred to them as “houses of heaven” where courtesans were often found. Greece The Ancient Greeks were the first people to document both male and female escorts. Many female escorts were independent and in some cases played important roles in Greek Society. Escorts were required to wear distinctive dresses and paid taxes on their earnings like any other profession. Documents show that Greek escorts were greatly desired around the world for their beauty and that some charged astonishing prices for their services. Roman Era The Romans embraced escorting, which was licensed, socially accepted, and very widespread throughout the empire with evidence that some brothels were government run. While it was perfectly acceptable for Roman citizens to hire escorts, working as an escort was often considered a shameful profession. Middle Ages During the middle ages, escorting and harlotry were at an all time high. Nearly every city and medium sized town had one or more brothels where the wealthy could go to drink and spend time with women. Many times a king would send his squires out to the local brothel to hire courtesans to entertain a noble guest. While some medieval churches frowned on this type of behavior, others licensed holy brothels of their own. During the Catholic Church’s main years of power, special badges were required to identify women as courtesans with the wealthier escorts able to skirt this law by dressing as noble women. Renaissance Period Due to mass outbreaks of syphilis in the 1400s and early 1500s, the escorting industry experienced a dramatic decline. The church began refusing service to women who were actively engaged in such activities in an attempt to discourage the remaining escorts. Revolutionary/Industrial Period As European influence continued to spread, so did the need for escorts. It was common for British soldiers to hire escorts in ports they controlled, especially India. New laws were passed that required escorts to visit doctors regularly for medical checkups, and in some countries government sanctioned brothels were the only form of escorting allowed. Famous Escorts in History With thousands of years of history behind it, there are hundreds of famous men and women that have helped make escorting into what it is today. Here are just a few of the most famous escorts in ancient history: Theodora Theodora lived in Constantinople around the year 500BC. She started out in a brothel before her talents were quickly stepping up her talents and becoming an actress. As an actress, Theodora would delight crowds with strange sexual shows with wild after parties. Eventually, she became a personal escort to the rich and powerful until she met Justinian, heir to the Byzantine Empire. They married, and just a few years after her death, she was anointed a saint. Phryne Phyrne was a famous hetaira (courtesan) considered to be one of the most beautiful women in all of Ancient Greece. Men threw money and gifts at her to attract her attention. When on trial accused of impiety, her lawyer, one of her lovers, failed to adequately defend her. Fearing a guilty verdict she removed her robes before the judges, who found themselves unable to condemn the beauty of Aphrodite to death. She was acquitted and immediately returned to her profession as Greece’s most popular courtesan. Su Xiaoxiao Known as Little Su, Su Xiaoxiao was a 5th century Chinese escort who was well known for her intellectual ability and raw beauty. Little Su did not wish to become a mistress of the rich and powerful and instead chose to share her beauty with common people. She died at a young age due to illness but her reputation and legacy live on even today. Her tomb was recently rebuilt in 2004 and Little Su has been responsible for inspiring many Chinese artists and writers. Thais Thais was a Greek hetaera who lived during the conquest of Alexander the Great, and was famously responsible for burning down Persepolis by simply giving a speech.

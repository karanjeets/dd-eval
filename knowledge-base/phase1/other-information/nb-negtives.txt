It operates F/A-18 Hornet multi-role fighters (pictured) and is controlled by No. 81 Wing. Formed at Pearce, Western Australia, in 1942, the squadron flew P-40 Kittyhawks in the South West Pacific during World War II. After the war, it re-equipped with P-51 Mustangs and deployed to Japan with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. The squadron was about to return to Australia when the Korean War broke out in 1950; it converted to Gloster Meteor jets in 1951 and claimed five MiG-15s and over 5,000 buildings and vehicles destroyed during the war for the loss of almost 60 aircraft. Re-equipped with CAC Sabres, the squadron briefly saw action during the Malayan Emergency in 1959–60. It operated Mirage III supersonic jets from 1969 to 1987, when it converted to Hornets. The squadron supplied aircraft to Diego Garcia in 2001–02 to support the war in Afghanistan, and deployed to the Middle East as part of the military intervention against ISIL in 2015–16. No. 77 Squadron is due to re-equip with F-35 Lightnings in 2021. (Full article...) Recently featured: Red rail Marilyn Monroe Half-Life 2: Episode One Archive By email More featured articles...

Curated by Paola Antonelli, the collection is part of the Applied Design installation in the Philip Johnson Architecture and Design Galleries. An initial fourteen games were announced in November 2012, with plans to expand the collection to up to forty games over time. Six more games were added in June 2013, as well as a game console. The video games are displayed in a minimalist fashion in order to showcase the design elements within them, while minimizing emotional factors such as nostalgia. Some games, such as Myst and The Sims, are solely displayed as a video presentation for practical reasons, but the museum is most interested in acquiring a game's proprietary source code.

Today's featured picture An interior view of the Hagia Sophia in 1852, when it was known as the Ayasofya Mosque. The building was originally constructed as a main Eastern Orthodox church and served in this role from 537 AD until the fall of Constantinople in 1453 (except between 1204 and 1261 when it was converted by the Fourth Crusaders to a Roman Catholic cathedral). When the Ottoman Turks under Mehmed II conquered Constantinople, the Hagia Sophia was converted into a mosque and Christian relics and art were either removed or plastered over. It remained a mosque for almost 500 years, before being converted into a museum between 1931 and 1935. Famous in particular for its massive dome, it is considered the epitome of Byzantine architecture and influenced the design of numerous mosques in what is now Istanbul.

This Signpost "Featured content" report covers material promoted from 15 to 21 May. Text may be adapted from the respective articles and lists; see their page histories for attribution. Featured articles Diamond Head are recognised as one of the leading members of the new wave of British heavy metal. 1908 presidential campaign poster of William Howard Taft and James S. Sherman Bradley Cooper at the French première of American Hustle Eight featured articles were promoted this week. Hasan al-Kharrat (nominated by Al Ameer son) (1861–1925) was one of the principal Syrian rebel commanders of the Great Syrian Revolt against the French Mandate. His main area of operations was in Damascus and its Ghouta countryside. Al-Kharrat was killed in a French ambush in Ghouta, and the revolt dissipated by 1927, but he gained a lasting reputation as a martyr of the Syrian resistance to French rule. Isidor Isaac Rabi (nominated by Hawkeye7) (1898–1988) was an American physicist and Nobel laureate, recognized in 1944 for his discovery of nuclear magnetic resonance, which is used in magnetic resonance imaging. He was also one of the first scientists in the United States to work on the cavity magnetron, which is used in microwave radars and microwave ovens. The new wave of British heavy metal (nominated by Lewismaster) was a nationwide musical movement that started in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s and achieved international attention by the early 1980s. It is best remembered for drawing on the heavy metal of the 1970s and infusing it with the intensity of punk rock to produce fast and aggressive songs. The DIY attitude of the new metal bands led to the spread of raw-sounding, self-produced recordings and a proliferation of independent record labels. Song lyrics were usually about escapist themes such as mythology, fantasy, horror and the rock lifestyle. William Harper (nominated by Cliftonian) (1916–2006) was a politician, general contractor and Royal Air Force fighter pilot who served as a Cabinet minister in Rhodesia from 1962 to 1968, and signed that country's Unilateral Declaration of Independence from Britain in 1965. Reg Pollard (nominated by Ian Rose) (1903–1978) was a senior commander in the Australian Army, serving as Chief of the General Staff from 1960 to 1963. After retiring from the military in 1963, Pollard became Honorary Colonel of the Royal Australian Regiment; he served as Australian Secretary to Queen Elizabeth II during the Royal Visit in 1970 and was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order the same year. Baleen whales (nominated by Dunkleosteus77) are a widely distributed and diverse parvorder of carnivorous marine mammals, and comprise four families and 15 species. They have two limbs that are modified into flippers. Baleen whales use their baleen plates to filter out food from the water. They have fused neck vertebrae, and are unable to turn their head at all. Baleen whales have two blowholes, and have a layer of fat under the skin to keep them warm. Although baleen whales are widespread, most species prefer the colder waters around the Northern and Southern poles. William Howard Taft (nominated by Wehwalt) (1857–1930) served as the 27th President of the United States and as the 10th Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, the only person to have held both offices. Taft was elected president in 1908, the chosen successor of Theodore Roosevelt, but was defeated for re-election by Woodrow Wilson in 1912. After leaving office, Taft returned to Yale as a professor, continuing his political activity and working against war through the League to Enforce Peace. In 1921, Warren G. Harding appointed Taft chief justice, a position in which he served until a few weeks before his death. Walt Disney (nominated by SchroCat) (1901–1966) was an American entrepreneur, animator, voice actor and film producer. A pioneer of the American animation industry, he introduced several developments in the production of cartoons. As a film producer he received 22 Academy Awards from 59 nominations and has won more individual Oscars than anyone else. He was presented with two Golden Globe Special Achievement Awards and one Emmy Award, among other honors. Several of his films are included in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress. Featured lists Three featured lists were promoted this week. Costa Rica is administratively divided into seven provinces which are subdivided into 81 cantons (nominated by Mattximus), and these are further subdivided into districts. Cantons are the only administrative division in Costa Rica that possess local government in the form of municipalities. Each municipality has its own mayor and several representatives, all of them chosen via municipal elections every four years. The largest canton by population is the capital San José with a population of 7005288054000000000♠288,054. The smallest canton by population is Turrubares with 7003551200000000000♠5,512 residents. The largest canton by land area is San Carlos, which spans 3,347.98 km2 (1,292.66 sq mi), while the smallest is Flores at 6.96 km2 (2.69 sq mi). Bipasha Basu (born 1979) is an Indian actress who has featured in over 50 films (nominated by Yashthepunisher and Vensatry), predominantly in Bollywood. She also hosted the television horror series Darr Sabko Lagta Hai in 2015. Bradley Cooper (born 1975) is an American actor and producer. As of 2016, he has won 21 awards from 70 nominations (nominated by Famous Hobo). His major nominations include four Academy Awards, two British Academy Film Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, three Screen Actors Guild Awards, and one Tony Award.

S. Jordan, 1885) Distribution of Greater Redhorse. The greater redhorse (Moxostoma valenciennesi) is a species of freshwater fish found in northeastern North America. It is the largest member of the genus Moxostoma, with a maximum length of 80 cm (31.5 in). Contents 1 Distribution and habitat 2 Description 3 Diet habits 4 Reproduction and life cycle 5 Conservation status 6 References Distribution and habitat[edit] The greater redhorse is endemic to states in the northcentral and northeastern United States as well as Ontario and Quebec in Canada. It is typically found in clear, relatively fast-moving rivers and in both shallow and deep waters in some lakes. They are unable to survive in even the slightest polluted waters. They, therefore have the ability to detect contaminated water sources. Description[edit] The greater redhorse is the largest fish in its genus, averaging around 46 cm (18 in) and 2 kg (4.4 lb), and reaching a maximum size of 80 cm (31.5 in) and 5.9 kg (13 lb). This species of fish has small eye sockets in contrast to their large rounded skull. On either side of the greater redhorse's body are reddish gold pectoral fins and pelvic fins. The posterior part of the dorsal fin varies from slightly concave at youth to slightly convex in adulthood. Their tail fins are only slightly notched, a trait that usually evolved in slow swimming bottom-feeders. The greater redhorse is most easily identified by its bright rusty red colored tail fin and the rows of black spots along its sides and back. Diet habits[edit] A bottom-feeder's mouth opens in the inferior position of the ventral surface of the fish. It feeds on various bottom dwelling organisms including, microcrustaceans, aquatic and larval insects, detritus, snails, and algae. Reproduction and life cycle[edit] Spawning for the greater redhorse begins in May or June. Before they are able to build their gravel and sand nests, they locate an area in moderately fast waters. Once male territories are established, the females will visit two males at a time and begin their spawning process. The two males will surround the female and perform a shaking motion releasing both the sperm and eggs from said gendered fish. Upon burial of the eggs, the parents leave with no further parental care provided. Following fertilization, the greater redhorse eggs will hatch six to eight days at a mean temperature of 19 °C. Growth rates of this species are controversial among various areas they inhabit. Conservation status[edit] Overall, the greater redhorse is being threatened in many of the northern states it calls home. In general, it is not a recreational sporting fish. However, the greater redhorse's status as a prey species is unknown. Because this species is impacted greatly by pollutants, their endangered status may come from a decreased conscientiousness of where wastes are disposed of.

He represented Cut Knife from 1944 to 1964 and Cut Knife-Lloydminster from 1964 to 1967 in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan as a Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) member. Biography[edit] He was born in Sentinel Butte, North Dakota and was educated at Saint Benedict's Academy and Saint Thomas Military College in Minnesota. Nollet served overseas with the American Expeditionary Force during World War I. After the war, with his father, he moved to Freemont, Saskatchewan, where he established a ranch that raised Aberdeen Angus cattle. Nollet served as reeve of the rural municipality of Hillsdale. He was a member of the United Farmers of Canada and of the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool.[1] In 1933, he married Patricia "Peggy" Chicilo.[2] Nollet served as deputy speaker for the provincial assembly and then was a member of the provincial cabinet, serving as Minister of Agriculture from 1946 to 1964. He helped develop the South Saskatchewan River Project. Nollet retired from politics in 1967.[1] In 1975, he was inducted into the Saskatchewan Agricultural Hall of Fame.[3] He died in Kelowna, British Columbia at the age of 89.[1] The Toby Nollet Bridge over the North Saskatchewan River was named in his honour.[4] References[edit] ^ a b c d Quiring, Brett.

Vesta is the brightest and second-most-massive asteroid. It suffered a crust-penetrating impact approximately one billion years ago. [1] The following is a collection of lists of exceptional asteroids in the Solar System. For the purposes of this article "asteroid" means minor planet up to the orbit of Jupiter, which includes the dwarf planet Ceres. For a complete list of minor planets in numerical order, see List of minor planets. Note: each asteroid is given a unique sequential identifying number after its orbit is precisely determined. Prior to this, asteroids are known only by their systematic name or provisional designation, such as "1950 DA". Contents 1 Physical characteristics 1.1 Largest by diameter 1.2 Most massive 1.3 Brightest from Earth 1.4 Exceptionally slowly rotating objects 1.5 Fastest-rotating objects 2 Orbital characteristics 2.1 Retrograde 2.2 Highly inclined 2.3 Trojans 2.4 Record-setting close approaches to Earth 3 Timeline 3.1 Landmark asteroids 3.2 Spacecraft targets 3.3 Numbered minor planets that are also comets 3.4 Minor planets that were misnamed and renamed 4 See also 5 Books 6 References 7 External links Physical characteristics[edit] Largest by diameter[edit] Estimating the sizes of asteroids from observations is difficult due to their irregular shapes, varying albedo (reflectivity), and small angular diameter. For example, pure C-type asteroids are much darker than most. Asteroids with only one or two axes measured may have a falsely inflated geometric mean diameter if the unknown second and/or third axis is noticeably smaller than the primary axis. Asteroid 16 Psyche has an IRAS diameter of 253 km, yet has a more recent and accurate geometric mean of only 186 km.

Based on IRAS data there are about 140 main-belt asteroids with a diameter greater than 120 km.[3] For a more complete list, see List of Solar System objects by size. The inner asteroid belt (defined as the region interior to the 3:1 Kirkwood gap at 2.50 AU) has few large asteroids. Of those in the above list, only 4 Vesta, 19 Fortuna, 6 Hebe, 7 Iris and 9 Metis orbit there. Most massive[edit] Below are the nineteen most massive measured asteroids.[4] The masses of asteroids are calculated from perturbations caused by Mars and other asteroids, except in those that have been visited by spacecraft where a direct mass determination is possible. Different sets of astrometric observations lead to different mass determinations; the biggest problem is accounting for the aggregate perturbations caused by all of the smaller asteroids.[5] The relative masses of the top twelve asteroids known, [4] compared to the remaining mass of the asteroid belt.

The proportions assume that the total mass is 3.0×1021 kg.) Significant uncertainties remain. For example, the uncertainty in the estimate of 31 Euphrosyne is enough for its low end to overlap with both 704 Interamnia and 511 Davida, which overlap each other and also with 532 Herculina, which overlaps with 15 Eunomia and 3 Juno. Juno barely overlaps 52 Europa, which in turn overlaps with 16 Psyche. That is, outside the top four, the order of all the asteroids is uncertain. However, none of the lesser asteroids, of which the most massive are thought to be 88 Thisbe (at 17–19×1018 kg), 7 Iris, 29 Amphitrite and 48 Doris (all in the range of ≈15×1018 kg), overlap with Europa or Psyche, so the first 12 asteroids in the chart above are likely to be the top dozen unless a hitherto unmeasured asteroid proves to be unexpectedly massive. The largest asteroids with an accurately measured mass, due to the fact that they have been (and are being) studied by the probe Dawn, are 1 Ceres with a mass of 939.3±0.5×1018 kg, and 4 Vesta at 259.076±0.001×1018 kg. The third-largest asteroid with an accurately measured mass, due to the fact that it has a moon, is 87 Sylvia at 14.78±0.06×1018 kg. For a more complete list, see List of Solar System objects by size. Other large asteroids such as 423 Diotima currently only have estimated masses.[7][8] Brightest from Earth[edit] Only Vesta regularly attains a brightness sufficient to be visible to the naked eye. The following asteroids can all reach an apparent magnitude brighter than or equal to the +8.3 attained by Saturn's moon Titan at its brightest, which was discovered 145 years before the first asteroid was found owing to its closeness to the easily observed Saturn. None of the asteroids in the outer part of the asteroid belt can ever attain this brightness. Even Hygiea and Interamnia rarely reach magnitudes of above 10.0. This is due to the different distribution of spectral types within different sections of the asteroid belt being such that the highest-albedo asteroids are all concentrated closer to Mars, and much lower albedo C and D types being common in the outer belt. Those asteroids with very high eccentricities will only reach their maximum magnitude on unusual occasions when their perihelion is very close to a heliocentric conjunction with Earth, or (in the case of 99942 Apophis) when the asteroid passes very close to Earth.

Exceptionally slowly rotating objects[edit] Rotation periods have been determined for only a small fraction of asteroids (from light curves or from radar studies). Most asteroids have rotation periods of less than 24 hours. There are 17 objects with a likely rotation period greater than 30 days (720 hours). Asteroids larger than 150 meters usually have rotation periods longer than 2 hours.

As of July 2015[update], of the 688,321 minor planets known, there are only 65 known retrograde minor planets.[11] In comparison, there are over 1920 comets with retrograde orbits. This makes retrograde minor planets the rarest group of all. High-inclination asteroids are either Mars-crossers (possibly in the process of being ejected from the Solar System) or damocloids. Some of these are temporarily captured in retrograde resonance with the gas giants.[12] Retrograde Name Inclination Discovery date Condition code obs number × obs arc[1] Comment 2005 SB223 091.419 !91.419° September 30, 2005 3 12200 Has a well-determined orbit with a data arc of 244 days (Uncertainty Parameter=1) 2014 MH55 091.49 !91.49° June 29, 2014 9 96 2010 EQ169 091.606 !91.606° March 8, 2010 9 32 2014 PP69 093.627 !93.627° August 5, 2014 5 4816 2015 BH311 095.575 !95.575° January 20, 2015 9 39 2014 JJ57 095.958 !95.958° May 9, 2014 3 61802 2014 HS150 096.456 !96.456° April 16, 2014 8 200 2013 BL76 098.607 !98.607° January 20, 2013 1 46716 Has a semi-major axis of 1254 AU, giving it the third largest semi-major axis of any known minor planet 2010 GW147 099.623 !99.623° April 14, 2010 3 93632 2011 MM4 100.446° June 24, 2011 4 36036 2014 XS3 100.934° December 8, 2014 9 55 2013 BN27 101.780° January 17, 2013 7 1425 2008 KV42 103.483° May 31, 2008 5 10449 (342842) 2008 YB3 105.031° December 18, 2008 1 864896 2010 GW64 105.273° April 6, 2010 4 9576 2012 YO6 106.914° December 22, 2012 4 6674 2009 DD47 107.431° February 27, 2009 7 1584 2007 VW266 108.345° November 12, 2007 7 2280 2015 MJ116 108.876° June 27, 2015 9 2011 SP25 108.987° September 20, 2011 5 3712 2011 OR17 110.345° May 21, 2010 1 75548 2005 TJ50 110.368° October 3, 2005 7 1488 2005 VX3 112.459° November 1, 2005 4 4050 Semi-major axis of 837AU, but has a somewhat short 81-day observation arc for such a large orbit 2010 OM1 118.689° July 28, 2010 5 3232 (65407) 2002 RP120 119.106° September 4, 2002 2 660275 This outer-planet crosser is a damocloid and SDO. 2010 PO58 121.229° August 5, 2010 9 168 2010 LG61 123.732° June 2, 2010 9 770 2015 KB157 124.316° May 28, 2015 9 2013 LU28 125.414° June 8, 2013 5 21560 2014 SQ339 128.499° September 9, 2014 7 1276 2000 DG8 129.478° February 25, 2000 3 44460 A damocloid and SDO.

The above table lists only numbered asteroids that are also comets. Minor planets that were misnamed and renamed[edit] In earlier times, before the modern numbering and naming rules were in effect, asteroids were sometimes given numbers and names before their orbits were precisely known. And in a few cases duplicate names were given to the same object (with modern use of computers to calculate and compare orbits with old recorded positions, this type of error no longer occurs). This led to a few cases where asteroids had to be renamed.[18] 330 Adalberta An object discovered March 18, 1892 by Max Wolf with provisional designation "1892 X" was named 330 Adalberta, but was lost and never recovered. In 1982 it was determined that the observations leading to the designation of 1892 X were stars, and the object never existed. The name and number 330 Adalberta was then reused for another asteroid discovered by Max Wolf on February 2, 1910, which had the provisional designation A910 CB. 525 Adelaide The object A904 EB discovered March 14, 1904 by Max Wolf was named 525 Adelaide and was subsequently lost. Later, the object 1930 TA discovered October 3, 1930 by Sylvain Arend was named 1171 Rusthawelia. In those pre-computer days, it was not realized until 1958 that these were one and the same object. The name Rusthawelia was kept (and discovery credited to Arend); the name 525 Adelaide was reused for the object 1908 EKa discovered October 21, 1908 by Joel Hastings Metcalf. 715 Transvaalia and 933 Susi The object 1911 LX discovered April 22, 1911 by H. E. Wood was named 715 Transvaalia. On April 23, 1920, the object 1920 GZ was discovered and named 933 Susi. In 1928 it was realized that these were one and the same object. The name Transvaalia was kept, and the name and number 933 Susi was reused for the object 1927 CH discovered February 10, 1927 by Karl Reinmuth. 864 Aase and 1078 Mentha The object A917 CB discovered February 13, 1917 by Max Wolf was named 864 Aase, and the object 1926 XB discovered December 7, 1926 by Karl Reinmuth was named 1078 Mentha. In 1958 it was discovered that these were one and the same object. In 1974, this was resolved by keeping the name 1078 Mentha and reusing the name and number 864 Aase for the object 1921 KE, discovered September 30, 1921 by Karl Reinmuth. 1095 Tulipa and 1449 Virtanen The object 1928 DC discovered February 24, 1928 by Karl Reinmuth was named 1095 Tulipa, and the object 1938 DO discovered February 20, 1938 by Yrjö Väisälä was named 1449 Virtanen. In 1966 it was discovered that these were one and the same object. The name 1449 Virtanen was kept and the name and number 1095 Tulipa was reused for the object 1926 GS discovered April 14, 1926 by Karl Reinmuth. 1125 China and 3789 Zhongguo The object 1928 UF discovered October 25, 1928 by Zhang Yuzhe (Y. C. Chang) was named 1125 China, and was later lost. Later, the object 1957 UN1 was discovered on October 30, 1957 at Purple Mountain Observatory and was initially incorrectly believed to be the rediscovery of the object 1928 UF. The name and number 1125 China were then reused for the object 1957 UN1, and 1928 UF remained lost. In 1986, the object 1986 QK1 was discovered and proved to be the real rediscovery of 1928 UF. This object was given the new number and name 3789 Zhongguo. Note Zhongguo is the Mandarin Chinese word for "China", in pinyin transliteration. Asteroid 1317 The object 1914 UQ discovered April 20, 1914 by G. N. Neujmin was named 787 Moskva (and retains that name to this day). The object 1934 FD discovered on March 19, 1934 by C. Jackson was given the sequence number 1317. In 1938, G. N. Neujmin found that asteroid 1317 and 787 Moskva were one and the same object. The sequence number 1317 was later reused for the object 1935 RC discovered on September 1, 1935 by Karl Reinmuth; that object is now known as 1317 Silvretta.

Contents 1 Education 2 Career 3 Personal life 4 Treatises 5 Footnotes Education[edit] Raysman was born in New York City, the son of Victor Raysman, a businessman, and Irene Davies Raysman, a professor. He grew up in Valley Stream, New York, a suburb of New York City, attending Valley Stream North High School. Raysman received a B.S. in 1968 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he majored in Industrial Management at the MIT Sloan School of Management and minored in computer science. Career[edit] After graduation from MIT, Raysman worked for the IBM Corporation as a systems engineer for six years, based in New York City. In that capacity he guided the information technology departments of major corporations in implementing new computer systems and upgrading to more advanced hardware. He programmed in computer languages such as Assembler, Cobol, IBM RPG and Fortran. While working for IBM Raysman attended Brooklyn Law School at night. During that time he joined the U.S.Army Reserve, where he served in the Military Police for six years, doing his basic training at Fort Gordon, in Augusta, Georgia. Being a systems engineer as well as a lawyer, Raysman realized that the law relating to the purchase and use of computer hardware and software was as yet undeveloped. Although academic articles relating to computer law were starting to appear in law reviews, there were no law firms professing to practice in it. Since the use of computers in a business context was increasing exponentially, Raysman decided, in 1978, to start his own firm in New York City specifically to counsel companies in those transactions. As part of his effort to distinguish the acquisition of software and hardware as an area of the law requiring specific knowledge and expertise, in the following years Raysman wrote articles for the New York Times,[1] the Harvard Business Review,[2] and the New York Law Journal, where in 1981 he became "co-author" of the first monthly column on Computer Law, written by associates under his byline. The New York Times twice cited Raysman as a legal expert on patents and software .[3] During the last two decades of the 20th century computer law expanded to include issues relating to software licensing, protection of intellectual property on the internet, eCommerce law and information technology employment issues such as outsourcing. These areas of the law are now encompassed in the term Intellectual Property Law. Raysman's firm, known as Brown, Raysman & Millstein, ultimately grew to 250 lawyers with offices in New York, Los Angeles, Silicon Valley, Hartford and Toronto. In 2006 Brown Raysman Millstein Felder & Steiner, as it was then known, merged with the San Francisco law firm of Thelen and became known as Thelen Reid Brown Raysman & Steiner, having 650 attorneys and offices worldwide. In 2008 Raysman left Thelen, when the firm disbanded. He now practices at the New York office of Holland & Knight. Raysman concentrates his practice in international outsourcing transactions. Raysman has litigated numerous reported cases for the New York State and Federal courts. He has been selected by Chambers as one of America's leading outsourcing lawyers.[4] Raysman continues to publish extensively on the topic of Intellectual Property Law, including three ghost-written treatises as well as newsletters and the monthly column that appears under his byline in the New York Law Journal. He is also a regular speaker in this field at numerous conferences, including those sponsored by the International Bar Association, the Outsourcing Interests Group and the Intellectual Technology Law Forum in Europe. Raysman is admitted to the New York and Connecticut State bars, the Supreme Court of the United States, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the U.S. District Courts for the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York. Personal life[edit] Raysman is married to the former Georgia M. Urbano, a graduate of the Columbia University School of Law who is also the former President and Chairman of the Nantucket Preservation Trust. He has four children.[citation needed] Treatises[edit] Computer Law: Drafting and Negotiating Forms and Agreements ( ]co-author of two-volume treatise updated twice yearly) Intellectual Property Licensing: Forms and Analysis ("co-author" of ghost-written treatise updated twice yearly) Emerging Technologies and the Law: Forms and Analysis ("co-author" of ghost-written two-volume treatise updated twice yearly) Footnotes[edit] ^ "Of Computers and the Law," New York Times, September 14, 1980 ^ "Manager Involvement Needed in Computer Selection" (1981) and "Don't Rush to Court When Your Computer Fails," (1984), Harvard Business Review ^ Teresa Riordan,"Prodigy's patent is being debated," Feb. 5, 1996; and "Borland gets a patent for making graphs from spreadsheets" Nov. 13, 1995. ^ "Chambers USA", Chambers and Partners, 2008 Authority control WorldCat Identities VIAF: 77678442 ISNI: 0000 0000 8271 1869 Retrieved from " https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Richard_Raysman&oldid=715676400" Categories: Living people 1946 births New York lawyers Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni MIT Sloan School of Management alumni Brooklyn Law School alumni Hidden categories: All articles with unsourced statements Articles with unsourced statements from March 2009 Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers Navigation menu Personal tools Not logged in Talk Contributions Create account Log in Namespaces Article Talk Variants Views Read Edit View history More Search Navigation Main page Contents Featured content Current events Random article Donate to Wikipedia Wikipedia store Interaction Help About Wikipedia Community portal Recent changes Contact page Tools What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Permanent link Page information Wikidata item Cite this page Print/export Create a book Download as PDF Printable version Languages Add links This page was last modified on 17 April 2016, at 09:03.

But some other expert will come along and verify. Jeanie B from JeanieBeanHandKnits 4:19 pm Jun 2, 2016 EDT Not an expert, but yes they can. amanda from SmallthingsbyAmanda 4:20 pm Jun 2, 2016 EDT yes a buyer can leave a review and open a case Miss S from GlassPalaceArts 4:22 pm Jun 2, 2016 EDT Yes they can do both. Kathy K from KKbraceletsandmore 4:32 pm Jun 2, 2016 EDT Yes, they can do both. They sort of have two different purposes, a buyer opens a case in order to get the item they ordered or their money back, a review is more to tell prospective buyers about their experience with the seller and how they liked the item. Ellen Mallett from elanknits 4:33 pm Jun 2, 2016 EDT As a buyer I would be really upset if I couldn't Sharky from SharkysWaters 5:47 pm Jun 2, 2016 EDT It depends. If the time line is open to leave a review they can leave one before opening a case. If they open the case first they have to wait until the case is closed to leave one. www.etsy.com/help/article/4493?ref=help_search_result Kasey Calkins from BerryButtonz 5:48 pm Jun 2, 2016 EDT Yes they can do both, however if you cancel an order they only have a couple days to leave a review before they are unable to.

Experience System for multiple Skills Thread: Experience System for multiple Skills Tags: data table, experience, skills, system mdmoberly said: 06-01-2016 03:33 PM 0 Experience System for multiple Skills Is there a simple was to compare a float (skill exp on char) to a data table that has a float (skill exp) and an int (skill lvl) and set the value of an int (skill lvl on char) depending on where on the data table the float is = to? Sorry if this doesn't make sense.. Basically a system that says okay, you have 1200 experience points so this is what level you should be. My data table right now has two columns, a Skill Lvl struct and a Skill Exp struct. My thought was compare my float to all the floats in the table to find the row it's between, and set my int to the int from that same row?.. but can't figure out how to do so. Any help would be awesome! Matt   Gbr said: 06-01-2016 04:20 PM 0 You can use structs for that and an array of float. One struct is from your character info, that contains its lv and xp. The array has, in each index, the current exp to reach the lv (index + 1). For ex: Character Struct Lv 2 Exp 200 Array ExpPerLv: 0: 0 1: 100 2: 200 3: 300 Each index must be read as the LV and the required XP as the value. The index '0' is the lv 1, and it needs '0' xp to advance to it. The index '1' is the lv 2, and it needs 100 xp to advance to... and so on.   mdmoberly said: 06-01-2016 06:12 PM 0 Okay, I think I understand! LV is line value I'm assuming..? I've never had to get the LV before but I'm sure I can find how to get it. But how would I do the float comparison? Do a find on the float array?   Ispheria said: 06-01-2016 06:38 PM 0 if you don't want to show the player how much more exp they need to lv, you can use a float curve, with the exp on the x (horizontal) and lv. on the y (vertical) and just floor whatever value you get at that exp. Makes it really easy when balancing the game, cause then you can just move some points around instead of having to retype every value to keep the leveling curve good   mdmoberly said: 06-01-2016 08:51 PM 0 Originally Posted by Gbr You can use structs for that and an array of float.

I've never had to get the LV before but I'm sure I can find how to get it. But how would I do the float comparison? Do a find on the float array? Haha, "lv" was intended to mean Level The line value you are assimilating is actually the index inside the array.   Ispheria said: 06-02-2016 09:16 AM 0 Originally Posted by mdmoberly Could I not create another float curve with lvl on x and exp on y to calculate remaining exp? That seems like it may work?? I mean, I don't see why it wouldn't work, but then you'd have to make sure that they match each other exactly, and if you're using curves instead of straight lines, it might be a little hard to do. But if each skill only has like 5 levels then it shouldn't be too much of a problem.   Log in Register Full Site Top Powered by vBulletin® Version 4.2.2 Copyright © 2016 vBulletin Solutions, Inc.

I used to susbscribe to the Walnut Creek CD-ROM sets starting back in the FreeBSD 2.0 days, but by the time 5.0 came along, Internet bandwidth downunder enabled affordable (and faster) cvsup updates. When FreeBSD 6 came out in 2005 I looked around and found the FreeBSD Foundation (founded 2000) and have been donating my $US 50 each year. See http://www.freebsdfoundation.org/ It's even a tax deduction for US residents <envy>. So, do you support the FreeBSD Foundation? If not, why not?

I have done in 2008. will continue in 2009 and in future too. If we could spread this idea of donating tiny amount to FreeBSD fund, it could do miracles!!!! For example : think of 1000 peoples in this globe, donating 3$ results 3000$ !!! For those people who are tight in fund can find at least 3$ by sacrificing something in personal life (that is how i find amount 2 donate) and find the amount. What count is the Activity/Habit of Donating (and Spreading this habit IS VERY IMPORTANT. SO AM WRITING THIS), not the size of fund in a single donation. When comparing the amount collected in this way with the amount donated by big corporates, it may seem silly. But think of : Once the habit of making tiny donations by individuals increases: say 10,000 individuals with 3$ = 30,000$ !!! It is easy to say NO. A reason to justify the same will be invented by our brain [ the fastest computer with best OS ]. Little drops of water make the mighty ocean. So Donate TINY AMOUNT now!! & Spread the idea in BIG SCALE. Become Strong Advocates of TINY DONATION vai chat, blog, forums, sms, phone, face2face talk, email, ... or what ever innovative medium you can find.
